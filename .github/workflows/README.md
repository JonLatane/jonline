# Jonline GitHub Workflows

It's worth noting there is some overlap in the workflows: `backend`, `flutter_web` and `tamagui_web` all do a few of the same things as `server_cd` and `preview_generator_cd`. The latter, though, is really specifically oriented towards creating a deliverable release. The former three are separated out so we can have separate badges and better separation of the various build processes.
