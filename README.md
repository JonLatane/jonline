# Jonline [![Server CI/CD Badge](https://github.com/jonlatane/jonline/actions/workflows/server_ci_cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonlatane/jonline/actions/workflows/server_ci_cd.yml) 
Jonline is an open-source, community-scale social network designed to be capable of "[dumfederating](#dumfederation)" with other Jonline instances/communities, making sharing between local-size instances easy. All web-facing features in Jonline - the Tamagui/React app, the Flutter app, and Media endpoints - use localStorage (or system storage, for native Flutter apps) and neither set nor read cookies at all.

The "dev" instance is up at [Jonline.io](https://jonline.io) (the Flutter app being at [Jonline.io/flutter](https://jonline.io/flutter)). Two "production" instances are also at [BullCity.Social](https://bullcity.social) and [OakCity.Social](https://oakcity.social). Unless I'm doing some testing with Jonline.io, all three should be configured to be able to federate with one another (or, for clients to federate between them). For anyone curious, all three (along with their corresponding Postgres and MinIO) live on a single-box DigitalOcean K8s instance. Between the 3 Load Balancers, storage, and compute resources, [it costs about $60/mo to run the 3 domains, though that cost can be brought closer to $40/mo](#cost-of-operation). (All also keep their media and HTML/CSS/JS behind CloudFlare's free CDN.)

## What is Jonline?
Jonline is a network of, and a protocol for, social networks. It aims to be something like [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), but as a social network released under the [AGPL](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-agpl-license/) (and also, Kubernetes/LetsEncrypt/CertManager-friendly). Use cases include:

* Neighborhoods, communities, or cities
* (Ex-)Coworkers wanting a private channel to chat
* Run/bike/etc. clubs
* App user groups
* Online game clans
* Board game groups
* D&D parties
* Local concert listings
* Event venue calendars

The core model of Jonline is that *each of these communities is run as its own Jonline instance*. Each of these instances and their data are literally *owned* by the organization (or a chosen "IT admin person" and/or "moderation team" for it). Finally, the same person's *accounts on all of these instances can be federated* (if the user chooses, and dependent upon server configurations and permissions, of course). Federation is simply a means to let, say, a user, Jeff, see their D&D DM also knows the guy from run club who left his wallet, *even if Jeff and the DM are not friends on the run club network*, but *only if the DM chooses* to federate their identity across both those networks.

One way to think of Jonline is as social media meets the email server model (I use Gmail, you use your ISP's email, we can still talk to each other), with a bit of the ListServ model too (it's *very* easy to set up a neighborhood Jonline instance, Posts function effectively identically to ListServ messages, and Events are basically just a nice extra feature ListServ doesn't have).

Another way to think of Jonline is that it's like Slack or Discord, except instead of messages/channels/voice chats, it's just for Posts and Events. And your Jonline instance is code you can actually see running on equipment you own, not proprietary code running on a corporation's servers.

A core goal is to make Jonline dogshit easy (üêïüí©EZ) for anyone else to deploy to any Kubernetes provider of their choosing (and to fork and modify). It's also (optimistically) simple and straightforward enough to serve as a starter for many projects, so long as they retain the [AGPL license Jonline is released under](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/LICENSE.md). All you need is a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster, `git`, `kubectl`, `make`, and a few minutes to get the [prebuilt image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jonlatane/jonline) up and running.

Why this goal for this project? The tl;dr is that it keeps our social media data decentralized and in the hands of people we at least kinda trust. See [Scaling Social Software via Federation](#scaling-social-software-via-federation) for more rants tho.

### Why Jonline vs. Mastodon/OpenSocial?
* [Jonline's Docker images are currently 120MB](https://hub.docker.com/r/jonlatane/jonline/tags), [Mastodon's are 500+MB](https://hub.docker.com/r/tootsuite/mastodon/tags), and [OpenSocial's are over 1GB](https://hub.docker.com/r/goalgorilla/open_social_docker/tags). Its BE is *fast* compared to any Rails BE. And being written in Rust, memory safety is built-in, and entire classes of backend errors that arise from using dynamic/GC'ed languages simply don't compile and thus go away (once you've written it so it *will* compile, as a developer).
* Jonline supports Events. Others don't.
* Jonline's UI and APIs are designed to let users browse federated User Profiles, Groups, Posts and Events with ease in a way not supported in other "fediverse" apps.
* Jonline servers serve up multiple UIs as well as the protocol docs.
* [Jonline Protocol Docs](https://jonline.io/docs/protocol) are arguably *as* comprehensive and *more* concrete than [ActivityPub Protocol Docs](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/). More comparison is below.
* Jonline's server images are structured so you only need one LoadBalancer (the things you typically pay for) per deploy/website, and really only one web-facing container (though it defaults to 2) per deploy.
    * Within the containers themselves, everything is handled by a single Rust BE binary. No scripting runtime. So containers are small, even with useful Linux tools like `psql` and `grpcurl` built in. They start *really fast*, and Kubernetes failovers work very smoothly.
* Jonline deploy scripts are designed to be so easy to deploy to Kubernetess you can be braindead and get it up and running for your website. Further, it's all just `Makefile`s and `kubectl` commands (though maybe that's a con for the reader üòÅ).

The goal of all this is to make it as easy as possible for local businesses to:
* Engage with customers on a platform customers enjoy.
* Use Jonline to share information about customers between each other, in a way customers can easily understand and consent to, without a central corporation being involved.
    * Example: make it easy for Kathy to share her band's show with the folks at her yoga studio, by cross-posting it to her yoga studio profile

#### Jonline as a protocol vs. ActivityPub
Jonline is also a protocol, much like ActivityPub. It's worth skimming both the [ActivityPub Protocol Docs](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) and the [Jonline Protocol Docs](https://jonline.io/docs/protocol), but this is a brief breakdown.

Notably, while ActivityPub specifies a server-to-server federation protocol, Jonline simply lets servers "recommend" other servers by hostname, with the "federation" done on the client side by communicating with the recommended servers based on user authorization. (Yes, this could barely defined as "federation" at all - but it's cheaper and effectively the same to users. The Jonline protocol simply calls this [dumfederation](https://jonline.io/docs/protocol#dumfederation).)

While ActivityPub is defined using HTTP(S) and JSON, Jonline is defined with gRPC (on port 27707, with optional TLS), using HTTP(S) for media and CDN-based host negotiation only (no JSON, anywhere). Broadly speaking, Jonline may be called "more opinionated" than ActivityPub as a social networking protocol, and covers more things than just social activity (including things like user-facing server configuration data, privacy policy, etc.).

Whereas ActivityPub has a flexible Activity model capable of holding varied metadata, Jonline's API definitions deliberately avoid allowing for metadata, and focus on statically-typed, specific models for Posts and Events. The Jonline data model is designed using composition, with Events' titles, descriptions, moderation, etc. belonging to a Post owned by them, over inheritance (i.e. making Event "extend" Post in OOP). Jonline leverages this to implement visibility and moderation controls for Posts and Events across the system all in one place.

In addition to Users, Posts, and Events, which could all be "described" by ActivityPub's specification, Jonline also has Media (designed to leverage external CDNs), Groups, Server Configuration, and moderation/visibility/permission management across everything as a first-class citizen.

The hope is to build more useful business objects - yes, your boring SalesForce/NetSuite/SAP type stuff - into this social protocol. So Jonline Payments, Products, Subscriptions, and who knows what else could, eventually, be gradually implemented atop the Jonline protocol, with all the same clear, concise, documentation, cross-language portability, and other benefits it offers.

All this is to say: it should be pretty straightforward to create, say, Ruby bindings for Jonline, and use them in Mastodon to make it work as a no-Events-support, no-Media-support Jonline instance. Or vice versa. This is back burner research, though. Get in contact if you're interested in contributing/learning to do this type of work!

### Cost of Operation
Currently, Jonline's recommended DigitalOcean setup costs $24/mo for the server plus $13/mo per domain (due mostly to the LoadBalancer for each), totaling around $60/mo to run.

It should be possible to bring this down to $24/mo for the server, plus $12/mo for a *single* load balancer, and then 60¬¢/mo per domain for 1GB Postgres and 5GB MinIO storage. The only thing is, the LB will need to also keep track of certificates in order to read `Host` headers and route traffic. Ideally the Jonline BE instances should still serve their data encrypted as well, simply functioning as `ClusterIP` rather than `LoadBalancer` services.

Contributions and discussion on this topic are welcome! Please [discuss or contribute on the GitHub issue here](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/issues/15).

Costs are designed to be predictable on most Kubernetes service providers. Jonline offers intuitive Makefile-based configuration in both a simple and advanced configuration (the latter of which is better for hosting many communities in a single Kubernetes cluster).

### Why *not* Jonline?
* It's not done.
* There's near-0% test coverage.
* It's just my own (Jon) thing I'm doing in my spare time. 
* There's no community for ongoing support yet. It's just me, Jon üôÉ But do get in contact if you're trying to use this!

## Features Overview
All of Jonline's features should be pretty familiar to most social media users. Notably, in both its web and Flutter UIs, Jonline is designed to present "My Media" as a top-level feature and let users delete and manage Media visibility independently of Posts, Events, Groups or anything else.

### Jonline Identifiers: Usernames, Group Names, and IDs
A key point of contention in the Fediverse is the notion of universal usernames and IDs. Jonline also supports Groups and Group Names (which work much like subreddits or Facebook groups). There's a lot of complex implementations around this in Mastodon and elsewhere. Since Jonline's protocols do not specify anything about server-to-server communication, none of that stuff is really necessary in the Jonline approach at all! At a high level, Jonline Usernames, Group Names, and IDs look like a mix between URLs and email addresses. An important feature of both Jonline Usernames and IDs is that they do not change when URL-encoded.

For instance: I can claim [jonline.io/jon](https://jonline.io/jon), [bullcity.social/jon](https://bullcity.social/jon), and [oakcity.social/jon](https://oakcity.social/jon) for myself. But if you decide to start an instance at [febreze.lol/jon](https://febreze.lol/jon) and I want to make an account and share with you (I absolutely would!), I'll just have to register as [febreze.lol/jonline-jon](https://febreze.lol/jonline-jon) or my username of choice to interact on there. (But, in the future, I will be able to interlink all 4 of these profiles to make them appear as verified alternate identities across the servers!)

**Jonline Usernames** are, essentially, a link to a profile. Jonline gives the top-level resource names to users; i.e., user `bob123` on [jonline.io](https://jonline.io) can be found at [jonline.io/bob123](https://jonline.io/bob123). Users can change their usernames, but User IDs are permanent (unless the server administration changes the ID offset; see below for details.) [The few usernames you can't use on Jonline are enumerated in this Rust source.](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/backend/src/rpcs/validations/validate_fields.rs)

Example Jonline usernames:

* [jonline.io/jon](https://jonline.io/jon): A user on [jonline.io](https://jonline.io).
* [bullcity.social/jon](https://bullcity.social/jon): A user on [bullcity.social](https://bullcity.social).
* [jonline.io/jon@bullcity.social](https://jonline.io/jon@bullcity.social): A view of [bullcity.social/jon](https://bullcity.social/jon) when using [jonline.io](https://jonline.io). (Note that [bullcity.social](https://bullcity.social) must permit [jonline.io](https://jonline.io) via CORS for loading to work.)

**Jonline Group Names** work much like usernames, but for groups. They are automatically derived from the actual group name (they are the field `Group.shortname`, derived from `Group.name` by removing non-word characters).

Example Jonline Group Names:

* [jonline.io/g/Fitness](https://jonline.io/g/Fitness): A group on [jonline.io](https://jonline.io).
* [bullcity.social/g/Running](https://bullcity.social/g/Running): A group on [bullcity.social](https://bullcity.social).
* [jonline.io/g/Running@bullcity.social](https://jonline.io/g/Running@bullcity.social) - a view of [bullcity.social/g/Running](https://bullcity.social/g/Running) when using [jonline.io](https://jonline.io). (Note that [bullcity.social](https://bullcity.social) must permit [jonline.io](https://jonline.io) via CORS for loading to work.)

**Jonline IDs** are numerical IDs for any entity type on a server. We might say: *in the context of Jonline.io*, Post ID `T6S8eoDmmtb` would be expected to be found at [jonline.io/post/T6S8eoDmmtb](https://jonline.io/post/T6S8eoDmmtb). (Note that the numerical portion of the ID is literally just a 64-bit integer encoded with base58 and a server-configurable offset. The best reference for how "Jonline ID Marshaling" works would be [these <90 lines, including test coverage, of Rust code.](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/backend/src/marshaling/id_marshaling.rs))

Example Jonline IDs:

* [jonline.io/post/T6S8eoDmmtb](https://jonline.io/post/T6S8eoDmmtb): A Post on [jonline.io](https://jonline.io).
* [bullcity.social/post/2g1j95Bw5gB](https://bullcity.social/post/2g1j95Bw5gB): A Post on [bullcity.social](https://bullcity.social).
* [jonline.io/post/2g1j95Bw5gB@bullcity.social](https://jonline.io/post/T6S8eoDmmtb): A view of [bullcity.social/post/2g1j95Bw5gB](https://bullcity.social/post/2g1j95Bw5gB) when using [jonline.io](https://jonline.io). (Note that [bullcity.social](https://bullcity.social) must permit [jonline.io](https://jonline.io) via CORS for loading to work.)
* [bullcity.social/event/4rAfoSKAuJo](https://bullcity.social/event/4rAfoSKAuJo): An Event on [bullcity.social](https://bullcity.social).
* [jonline.io/event/4rAfoSKAuJo@bullcity.social](https://jonline.io/event/4rAfoSKAuJo@bullcity.social) - a view of [bullcity.social/event/4rAfoSKAuJo](https://bullcity.social/event/4rAfoSKAuJo) when using [jonline.io](https://jonline.io). (Note that [bullcity.social](https://bullcity.social) must permit [jonline.io](https://jonline.io) via CORS for loading to work.)

### People, Followers and Friends
Jonline allows users to create accounts and login with nothing but a username/password combo. Anyone can Follow anyone, but users can require approval for Follow Requests. Two users who Follow each other are Friends.

### Groups and Memberships
Jonline supports Groups, which are much like Usenet groups, Facebook groups, or subreddits.

### Media
Jonline `Media` is straightforwardly built on content-types and blob storage. It's the reason Jonline requires S3/MinIO. Unlike `Post`s and `Event`s, `Media` is generally not shared directly. It is instead associated with `Post`s and `Event`s (for media listings) as well as Users and Groups (for their avatars).

Media is the *only* part of Jonline's APIs offered over HTTP as well as gRPC/gRPC-over-HTTP. (Hopefully the reasons for this are obvious: easy browser streaming and cache utilization for things like images.) Details on the HTTP Media APIs are in the ["Media" section](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/docs/protocol.md#media) of the [protocol documentation](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/docs/protocol.md).

All Media also carries `Visibility` and `Moderation` values that can be modified in the APIs, but are not currently enforced. Note that any Media visibility updates and/or deletions may take time to propagate fully, depending upon how a given Jonline instance's CDN setup works.

### Posts
`Post`s follow a Twitter- or Reddit- like model. They have a [`PostContext`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/docs/protocol.md#jonline-PostContext) as well as all-optional `title`, `link`, and `description` string values. A top-level post is stored generally the same as a reply. Posts also carry a `Visibility` and `Moderation` value that is enforced by the APIs.

Posts are also reused for Events, and will be similarly reused for future features. For developers: this is something like ActiveRecord Polymorphism, but using composition rather than inheritance at the ORM level. For users: Replies, Events, and other Jonline types track their title, description, visibility, moderation, etc. via a Post internally.

#### GroupPost
A key differentiator between `Post` and `Media` is that `Post`s and types that use them are "group-aware." That is to say: `GroupPost` exists, 
linking any unique `Group` to any unique `Post`, along with the `User` who created that link.

### Events
`Event`s are a thin layer atop `Post`s. Any Event has a single Post, as well as at least one EventInstance. An EventInstance has a start time, end time, location, and RSVP/attendance data. Group Events work through the `GroupPost` mechanism.

### Future Feature Roadmap
Jonline is currently in the 0.2.x phase of development. Its phases are:

* 0.1.x (old) - Basic gRPC social network with Users, Follows, Groups, Posts and Events, and multiple clients/UIs (React Web and Flutter).
* 0.2.x (current) - Fully federated gRPC social network - able to view Posts/People/Events from oakcity.social on jonline.io, etc.
  * Most federation features are being built atop React Web. Flutter app still functional for login and listing Users, Groups, and Posts, though comparatively less featureful otherwise. This is fine, as web is really the priority given what Jonline is and the current politics behind app stores. A sad state of affairs, though.
  * A dedicated iOS/Android developer who has the time and faith to deal with Apple/Google would be a welcome contributor!
* 0.3.x/0.4.x - Based on which is ready first, 0.3.x and 0.4.x will mark the releases of:
  * Web push notification support for discussions, and more chat-oriented features generally once that's in place.
    * Again, interested iOS/Android devs could make welcome contributions during this work. Jonline's current environment makes Web push the sensible thing to prioritize on my own end.
  * JBL, a load balancer, which will make hosting lots of domains affordable.
* 0.5.x/0.6.x - Music and Video streaming features. These could also easily be added sooner, but are a backburner priority for me for now. Wanna change my mind? Buy me *lots* of coffees and beers below üôÉ
* There are lots of other features that could be added (see below), but this is the immediate priority set.
* Jonline will only ever get a 1.0.x release if I become a millionaire from it, so mash these payment buttons and put in big numbers if you want me building this stuff full time:

[![Buy me a coffee!](https://img.shields.io/badge/üôè%20buy%20me%20a%20coffee%20‚òïÔ∏è-venmo-information?style=for-the-badge&labelColor={}&color={})](https://account.venmo.com/u/Jon-Latane)
[![Buy me a beer!](https://img.shields.io/badge/üôè%20buy%20me%20a%20beer%20üç∫-paypal-information?style=for-the-badge&labelColor={}&color={})](https://paypal.me/JLatane)

Other potential future features, that may in particular be of interest to small/medium/local businesses, and to cities/counties that want to support their local businesses, include:

* Payments
    * Jonline should support user-to-user payments via Apple Pay, Venmo, etc.
* Products
    * Products should be flexible enough to be used for neighborhood buy/sell groups, or for independent artists or artist collectives to have a web store presence (with community/social features around it).
    * Payments should be built upon Jonline Payments.
* Transport
    * For either products or humans.
    * Fulfillment side of Jonline Products.
    * Built atop OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, or possibly let the user/server choose implmementation.
    * OSS, social-baed competitor to Uber/Lyft.

Again, if you want these features prioritized, reach out to me in any way, but especially with those payment buttons above üôè

## Documentation
Jonline documentation consists of Markdown in the [`docs/` directory](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/docs), starting from [`docs/README.md`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/docs/README.md).

### Dumfederation
A key thing that separates Jonline from Mastodon and other Fediverse projects is that it *does not* support server-to-server communication. Essentially, the only server-to-server communication is via "recommended servers," which will eventually also let admins enable CORS to control where users can see content and user information from their servers.

This approach does not seek to be particularly innovative or groundbreaking technologically. It simply aims to make it easier for people to use *existing* web standards to interact, share, plan, and play with each other, and make administrating a server simple enough that nearly anyone can do it. All you need to worry about as an administrator in this regard is a [list of servers like this](http://jonline.io/server/https%3Abullcity.social?section=federation) - literally nothing but a list of hosts.

### Protocol Documentation
A benefit of being built with gRPC is that [Jonline's generated Markdown documentation is relatively easy to read and complete](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/docs/protocol.md#jonline-Jonline). Jonline renders documentation as Markdown, and converts that Markdown to HTML with a separate tool. Jonline servers also always include a copy of their own protocol documentation (i.e., [https://jonline.io/docs/protocol](https://jonline.io/docs/protocol), [https://bullcity.social/docs/protocol](https://bullcity.social/docs/protocol), and [https://oakcity.social/docs/protocol](https://oakcity.social/docs/protocol)).

### Project Components
The following components are *literally* just a "nice to read" breakdown of the overall directory structure of this repository. Nonetheless, this should be a useful first pass for anyone hoping to contribute to Jonline.

#### gRPC APIs
The [gRPC APIs are defined in `protos/`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/protos).

#### Architecture/Deployment Management
[Jonline architecture docs live in `docs/architecture`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/docs/architecture).

At its core, Jonline is a boring client-server app; the Browser/App, HTTP server, gRPC server, PostgreSQL, and MinIO interact thusly:

![Jonline Application Architecture](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/docs/architecture/Service_Architecture.svg)

Generally, Jonline is designed to be straightforward to deploy to Kubernetes clusters so long as you have `make`, `kubectl`, and `jq`. To this end, Jonline has a "simple" deployment structure, and a more scalable alternative is in the process of being implemented:

[Jonline's architecture docs](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/docs/architecture) also cover and link to such topics as:

* [Deployment management, in `deploys/`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/deploys)
* [TLS cert generation, in `deploys/generated_certs`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/deploys/generated_certs)

[CI/CD logic is defined in `.github/workflows/`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/.github/workflows). If you can set up a Kubernetes deployment with the instructions in [`deploys/`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/deploys), hooking into the Server

#### Rust Backend
The [Rust backend, in `backend/`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/backend), is built with [Diesel](https://diesel.rs) and [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic).

#### Frontends
[Jonline Frontends are grouped together in `frontends/`.](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/frontends) Specific iOS, Android, and/or desktop frontends would be welcome contributions!

##### Web (Tamagui/React/Next.js) Frontend
The [Tamagui frontend, in `frontends/tamagui`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/frontends/tamagui), is the "public Web face" of any Jonline instance. It's built with [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) (a somewhat Flutter-like UI toolkit and build system built atop [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [React](https://react.dev), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), and [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org)), along with [Redux](https://redux.js.org) among others.

Notably, in the future, with Tamagui, it should be possible to build iOS/Android apps from the existing Jonline source (after some effort to port less-native-friendly third-party components).

##### Flutter Frontend
The [Flutter frontend, in `frontends/flutter`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/frontends/flutter), is built with vanilla Flutter, [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider), [`auto_route`](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route), and [`protoc_plugin`](https://pub.dev/packages/protoc_plugin), among others.



## Quick deploy to your own cluster
If you have `kubectl` and `make`, you can be setup in a few minutes. (If you're looking for a quick, fairly priced, scalable Kubernetes host, [I recommend DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/1eaa3f9e536c).) First make sure `kubectl` is setup correctly and your instance has the `jonline` namespace available with `kubectl get services` and `kubectl get namespace jonline`:

```bash
$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.245.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   161d
# You should not be using a Kubernetes namespace named jonline; otherwise, existing services could be overridden.
$ kubectl get namespace jonline
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "jonline" not found
```

To begin setup, first clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline.git
cd jonline
```

Next, from the repo root, to create Postgres, Minio and two load-balanced Jonline servers in the namespace `jonline` (plus a few recurring jobs), run:

```bash
# THIS STEP WILL COST MONEY WITH MOST KUBERNETES PROVIDERS. ($12/mo. at DigitalOcean)
# The deploy_be_external_create Make target, specifically, will create the Joline service as a K8s LoadBalancer.
# Of course, it costs nothing to use Minikube.
# To deploy for use with a different ingress (say, a shared nginx, or Jonline's pending internal LB), use deploy_be_internal_create or deploy_be_internal_insecure_create to deploy it as a K8s ClusterIP instead.
make deploy_data_create deploy_be_external_create
```

That's it! You've created Minio and Postgres servers along with an *unsecured Jonline instance* where ***passwords and auth tokens will be sent in plain text*** (You should secure it immediately if you care about any data/people, but feel free to play around with it until you do! Simply `make deploy_data_delete deploy_data_create deploy_be_restart` to reset your server's data.) Because Jonline is a very tiny Rust service, it will all be up within seconds. Your Kubenetes provider will probably take some time to assign you an IP, though.

Simply `kubectl delete namespace jonline` to delete your deployment (or see below for more detailed management instructions).

### Deployment, domain, and TLS certificate management; deploying multiple `jonline` instances to different namespaces in the same cluster; and (yet-incomplete) integrated cross-K8s-namespace load balancing

[`deploys/Makefile`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/deploys/Makefile), [`deploys/generated_certs/Makefile`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/deploys/generated_certs/Makefile), and a few of Jonline's Rust binaries (mostly the main `jonline` server) provide the tools to update your deployment, point a domain at it, manage TLS certificates, and more.

For details on these scenarios and more when deploying to your own cluster, see [`deploys/README.md`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/deploys/README.md) and [`deploys/generated_certs/README.md`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/deploys/generated_certs/README.md).

## Motivations
Current social media and messaging solutions all kind of suck. The early open source software (OSS) movement, dating to the 80s, was generally right about many of the problems that have arisen mixing a market(ing)-based economy with social computing. If we entrust our social interactions to applications with closed source run on private Alphabet, Meta, Apple, etc. servers, *of course we're going to see the disinformation and effective-advertising-driven consumerism that plague the world today*. These models are profitable.

Meanwhile, email has existed for a *long time* even though it's not particularly profitable. Notably, email is a federated protocol. You can use any email provider to talk to anyone else on any other email provider. At any time, you can take all your message history to any other email provider. It's even easy to set up forwarding/notifying contacts of an address change *just because* the email protocol is so standardized. And while, yes, spam was a problem at one point, the consequences of social media meeting data-driven advertising have been demonstrably more problematic and harder to solve via legislation.

There isn't an open federated protocol like email for a complete posts+events+messaging package, even though this is essentially how most people use a large amount of their screen time. Lots of non-open, privatized implementations exist, like Facebook, Google+, and so forth. Other federated protocols like XMPP and CalDAV have replicated many of the communication features we use social media for, but are really meant for decades-old problems rather than what social media apps "solve." XMPP and CalDAV have seen varying degrees of success, but like many protocols more than a decade old, they're a bit obscure and hard to use; most devs only use "high-level" libraries to do this kind of work. Fortunately, in the last decade or so, Google has built and refined a free way to [create a protocol ourselves](https://grpc.io) that works in virtually any language and is straightforward enough for most developers.

So, Jonline is a shot at implementing federated, open social media, in a way that is easy for developers to modify and, perhaps most importantly, for *users to understand*.

### Scaling Social Software via Dumfederation
At the same time as the closed source/private server model has grown due to its profitability, software complexity has grown immensely to handle scaling these "modern" applications. We have ETLs, data lakes, statistics, and near-infinite ways of easily creating "trillions of points"-size data sets that require hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of computing power, and leveraging them for any number of rarely-publicly-disclosed purposes (mostly "make money").

But is scaling social media applications in this way *necessary for people to socially interact, sharing pictures and videos with friends and their favorite celebrities and arists*? Or is it *the best way to keep data available for marketing and other private use*? Or more simply: are we optimizing for profit, or for actual computer performance? There are many legitimate applications for, say, MapReduce across a huge privately-owned cluster, like making the entire Internet searchable. But for communicating with a network of friends you know in real life, and artists/actors/academics/poets/etc., it's not really necessary.

Jonline is a federated social network. The general idea is that it should provide a functional network with a single server, but that you should be able to communicate with users on other servers from a single account. This is handled via sharing of OAuth2 auth tokens between servers.

A next step in Jonline's [dumfederation](https://jonline.io/docs/protocol#Dumfederation) model *might* be credential management for external Jonline servers. I.E., letting users store a Refresh token for `bullcity.social` in their `oakcity.social` user data, so you they can directly comment on `bullcity.social` Posts and Events from `oakcity.social`. But is this *necessary*? Even with the existing protocols, with *no* server-to-server communication, it should be easy to integrate *viewing* federated servers, and letting me interact as a user on both `bullcity.social` and `oakcity.social`. And in fact, the web *already* defines CORS protocols which give the owners and users a great deal of control and security. So ultimately, being a client-server *only* federated network - or micro-federated network - makes more sense for Jonline.
