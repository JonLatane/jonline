# Jonline
Jonline is an open-source server+client for maintaining a small-ish (up to millions, but maybe not hundreds of millions of users), localized social network, letting anyone else set up their own private network, and making it easy to federate lots of Jonline instances and profiles together. What is federation in software? The tl;dr is that you can think of Jonline as social media meets the email server model (I use Gmail, you use your ISP's email, we can still talk to each other), with a bit of the ListServ model too (it's *very* easy to set up a neighborhood Jonline instance, Posts function effectively identically to ListServ messages, and Events are basically just a nice extra feature ListServ doesn't have).

A core goal is to make Jonline dogshit easy (üêïüí©EZ) for anyone else to deploy to any Kubernetes provider of their choosing (and to fork and modify). It's also (optimistically) simple and straightforward enough to serve as a starter for many projects, so long as they retain the [GPLv3 license Jonline is released under](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/LICENSE.md). All you need is a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster, `git`, `kubectl`, `make`, and a few minutes to get the [prebuilt image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jonlatane/jonline) up and running. (Validation steps also require `grpcurl`, which should be easy to install via Homebrew, apt, etc.)

Why this goal for this project? The tl;dr is that it keeps our social media data decentralized and in the hands of people we at least kinda trust. See [Scaling Social Software via Federation](#scaling-social-software-via-federation) for more rants tho.

### Quick deploy to your own cluster
If you have `kubectl` and `make`, you can be setup in a few minutes. (If you're looking for a quick, fairly priced, scalable Kubernetes host, [I recommend DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/1eaa3f9e536c).) First make sure `kubectl` is setup correctly and your instance has the `jonline` namespace available with `kubectl get services` and `kubectl get namespace jonline`:

```bash
$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.245.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   161d
$ kubectl get namespace jonline
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "jonline" not found
```

To begin setup, first clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline.git
cd jonline
```

Next, from the repo root, to create a DB and two load-balanced servers in the namespace `jonline` (which will be auto-created), run:

```bash
make deploy_db_create deploy_be_create
```

That's it! You've created an *unsecured instance* where ***passwords and auth tokens will be sent in plain text***. Because Jonline is a very tiny Rust service, it will all be up within seconds. Your Kubenetes provider will probably take some time to assign you an IP, though. To view your whole deployment, use `make deploy_be_get_all`. Use `make deploy_be_get_external_ip` to see what your service's external IP is (until set, it will return `<pending>`).

```bash
$ make deploy_be_get_external_ip
188.166.203.133
```

Finally, once the IP is set, to test the service from your own computer, use `make test_deploy_be` (you need `grpcurl` for this; `brew install grpcurl` works for macOS):

```bash
$ make test_deploy_be
grpcurl 188.166.203.133:27707 list
jonline.Jonline
grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection
```

That's it! You're up and running, although again, *it's an unsecured instance* where ***passwords and auth tokens will be sent in plain text***.

#### Securing your deployment
Jonline uses üêïüí©EZ, boring normal TLS certificate management to negotiate trust around its decentralized social network. If you're using DigitalOcean DNS you can be setup in a few minutes.

See [`generated_certs/README.md`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/tree/main/generated_certs) for quick TLS setup instructions, either [using Cert-Manager (recommended)](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/generated_certs/README.md#use-cert-manager-recommended), [some other CA](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/generated_certs/README.md#use-certs-from-another-ca) or [your own custom CA](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/generated_certs/README.md#use-your-own-custom-ca).

See [`backend/README.md`](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/backend/README.md) for more detailed descriptions of how the deployment and TLS system works.

## Motivations
Current social media and messaging solutions all kind of suck. The early open source software (OSS) movement, dating to the 80s, was generally right about many of the problems that have arisen mixing a market(ing)-based economy with social computing. If we entrust our social interactions to applications with closed source run on private Alphabet, Meta, Apple, etc. servers, *of course we're going to see the disinformation and effective-advertising-driven consumerism that plague the world today*. These models are very profitable.

Meanwhile, email has existed for a *long time* even though it's not very profitable. Notably, email is a federated protocol. You can use any email provider to talk to anyone else on any other email provider. At any time, you can take all your message history to any other email provider. It's even easy to set up forwarding/notifying contacts of an address change *just because* the email protocol is so standardized. And while, yes, spam was a problem at one point, the consequences of social media meeting data-driven advertising have been demonstrably more problematic and harder to solve via legislation.

There isn't an open federated protocol like email for a complete posts+events+messaging package, even though this is essentially how most people use a large amount of their screen time. Lots of non-open, privatized implementations exist, like Facebook, Google+, and so forth. Other federated protocols like XMPP and CalDAV have replicated many of the communication features we use social media for, but are really meant for decades-old problems rather than what social media apps "solve." XMPP and CalDAV have seen varying degrees of success, but like many protocols more than a decade old, they're a bit obscure and hard to use; most devs only use "high-level" libraries to do this kind of work. Fortunately, in the last decade or so, Google has built and refined a free way to [create a protocol ourselves](https://grpc.io) that works in virtually any language and is straightforward enough for most developers.

So, Jonline is a shot at implementing federated, open social media, in a way that is easy for developers to modify and, perhaps most importantly, for *users to understand*.

### Features/Single-server usage
The intended use case for Jonline is thus:

I (Jon üòäüëã) will run the Jonline server at https://jonline.io. It's fully open to the web and I'm paying for the DB behind it and the k8s cluster on it. Friends who want to connect with me can register for an account and communicate with me and with each other.

#### Posts
To keep things straightforward, all Posts in Jonline have global visibility. Twitter is easily the closest comparison.

#### Events
Events may be public, private, or private with friend invitations.

### Multi-server usage
Suppose you have two accounts with friends, say, on `jonline.io` and `bobline.com`. To federate your accounts, you may simply pass an `auth_token` from your `bobline.com` account that you use to talk to Bob (who I don't know) into `jonline.io`. The general idea is that users can choose to keep their primary account with the person they trust the most. Maybe it's not me üò≠ But that's fine; I won't even know!

## Technical stuff
You can create a Jonline account right now! I will probably delete it eventually though

```sh
grpc_cli call be.jonline.io:27707 CreateAccount 'username: "hi-you", password: "very-secure"'
```
### Scaling Social Software via Federation
At the same time as the closed source/private server model has grown due to its profitability, software complexity has grown immensely to handle scaling these "modern" applications. But is scaling social media applications in this way *necessary for what people use these applications for*? Or is it *the best way to keep data available for marketing and other private use*? Or more simply: are we optimizing for profit, or for actual computer performance? There are many legitimate applications for, say, MapReduce across a huge privately-owned cluster, like making the entire Internet searchable. But for communicating with a network of friends you know in real life, I don't really think it's necessary.

Jonline is a federated social network. The general idea is that it should provide a functional network with a single server, but that you should be able to communicate with users on other servers from a single account. This is handled via sharing of OAuth2 auth tokens between servers.

#### Technical underpinnings
The core of Jonline is a very generic, boring gRPC definition of OAuth2 [authentication](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/protos/authentication.proto) with a small [federation](https://github.com/JonLatane/jonline/blob/main/protos/federation.proto) protocol atop it. Hopefully, most developers who have used OAuth2 should understand how Jonline works just by reading those two files (even those familiar with Protobuf/gRPC). If not (and really, especially if so) please make some PRs!
