# the job's startup delay (if any), run the job's binary, sleep the job's
# interval, repeat -- forever, one Unix fork per job.
#
# Copied verbatim into the Homebrew and Linux release packages, alongside the
# other binaries (jonline-server, delete_expired_tokens, ...), by the
# create_homebrew_release / create_linux_release jobs in
# .github/workflows/server_ci_cd.yml. It's invoked by those packages'
# `jonline jobs` / `jonline server_and_jobs` launcher commands (see
# docs/linux_jonline.sh and docs/homebrew_jonline.sh) -- don't hand-edit a
# shipped copy, edit this file instead.
#
# To add a job, append a "binary_name startup_delay_seconds interval_seconds"
# entry to JOBS below -- binary_name must have a matching backend/src/bin/*.rs.
# Each job's binary is resolved (in this order):
#   1. ./binary_name                    (Homebrew macOS package; single-arch)
#   2. ./binary_name-<amd64|arm64>      (Linux tarball; arch-suffixed binaries)
#   3. cargo run --bin binary_name --   (running from a source checkout)
#

# Job control: makes each `&`-launched loop below its own process group
# leader, so `kill -TERM -- "-$pid"` in the trap can reach not just the loop
# itself but whatever it's currently running too -- notably `cargo run`,
# which forks the actual job binary as a child that a plain `kill $pid`
# would otherwise orphan (bash only kills the loop's shell, not its
# grandchildren).
