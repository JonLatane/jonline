                '''Several years ago I published my first mobile app, Topologica for Android.

### Features
* A MIDI sequencer that works basically like a TR-8 (built for 4/4 in 16th notes).
* A unique way of navigating through chord progressions in an "orbifold."
* The ability to, in real-time, rewrite your sequences as you navigate through chord progressions.
    * This really feels like a game to the end user :)
* Support for MIDI over USB (or Bluetooth, with other apps)

### Built with
* Kotlin
* Anko (now defunct)
* Android APIs
* FluidSynth

Topologica was renamed, open-sourced, and lives on as "BeatScratch Legacy" on the Play Store. 
Large parts of Topologica/BeatScratch Legacy live on in my current app, BeatScratch, available 
for iOS, macOS, Android and web.

I plan to re-implement the Orbifold in BeatScratch, at which point this app will be deprecated.
