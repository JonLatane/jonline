module Components.Authors exposing (avatar, avatarUrl, badges, compactBadges, href, link, name)

{-| Everything about displaying a `Proto.Jonline.Author` -- the
post/authorship-centric, cacheable-in-the-UI sibling of `User` embedded
directly in a `Post` (see `authentication.proto`'s own doc comment on
`Author`: "UI can cross-reference user details from its own cache (for things
like admin/bot icons)"). Since an `Author` already carries everything needed
to show one -- `username`, `avatar`, and `permissions` -- this module owns the
whole "avatar + name + profile link + Admin/Run Bots badges" combo
(`link`, built from `avatar`/`name`/`href`/`compactBadges`) as one shared
piece, rather than each caller assembling its own from parts.

`Post.author` is only ever a `Maybe Author` (an author-less post shouldn't
normally happen, but the proto doesn't guarantee one), so every function here
takes a `Maybe Author` and degrades gracefully -- `name` falls back to
"unknown", `href`/`avatarUrl` to `Nothing`, `link` to a plain (non-clickable)
`span`.

Used by `Components.Posts`' `postCard`/`postDetail`, `Components.PostReplies`'
`replyCard`, and `Shared.Breadcrumbs`' `replyCardView` -- all four now show
the exact same author rendering, badges included, rather than `PostReplies`
(the one place badges were first added) alone.

`badges`/`compactBadges` also work directly against a `Proto.Jonline.User`
(see `Components.Pages.UserProfilePage.usernameHeading`) -- both types have
their own `permissions : List Permission` field, so these two are written
against the structural `{ a | permissions : List Permission }` rather than
either concrete type.

Two badge renderings, both ordered Admin-then-Business-then-Run-Bots (if a
user/author has more than one):

  - `badges` -- verbose, as shown atop a profile page: Admin gets visible
    "🛡️ Admin" text, Business and Run Bots are bare emoji ("💼"/"🤖", no
    equally short label for either), all still with a `title` tooltip.
  - `compactBadges` -- for inline use next to a name (`link`'s own use),
    where there's no room for "Admin" as visible text: all bare emoji,
    `title`-only.

Either returns `[]` for an unprivileged user/author, so callers can just
append the result without their own empty-badges check.

{-| An author's display name -- "unknown" if `maybeAuthor` is `Nothing`
(shouldn't normally happen, but `Post.author` is optional) or has no
`username` set.

name : Maybe Author -> String

        |> Maybe.withDefault "unknown"


{-| An author's profile link -- `Nothing` if `maybeAuthor` is `Nothing`. The
author is always on `hostServerHost` (the same server as the post it came
from; `Author` has no host of its own to look elsewhere) -- see
`Components.Users.profileHref`, which already falls back to `/user/:id` if
the username isn't routable.

                    { userId = author.userId, username = Maybe.withDefault "" author.username }
            )


{-| An author's avatar URL -- `Nothing` if `maybeAuthor` is `Nothing`, `server`
isn't resolved yet (e.g. still connecting), or the author just has no avatar
set. `server` needs to be the actual resolved `Shared.AccountsPanel.Server` --
building a media URL needs its connection details, not just its hostname (see
`Shared.AccountsPanel.mediaUrl`).
-}

avatarUrl maybeServer maybeAccount maybeAuthor =
    Maybe.map2 (\server author -> Users.authorAvatarUrl server maybeAccount author) maybeServer maybeAuthor
        |> Maybe.andThen identity


{-| A small avatar/placeholder for an author, matching the size of the
Accounts Panel toggle's own avatars (`.post-author-avatar`, see `posts.css`).
Falls back to an initial-letter placeholder the same way `UI.imageOrInitial`
does elsewhere in the app; duplicated here rather than reusing that function
since `UI` itself imports `Components.Posts` (for `postCard`), so the reverse
import would be a cycle.
-}
avatar : String -> Maybe String -> Html msg

        Nothing ->
            div [ classes [ "post-author-avatar", "placeholder" ] ] [ text (AccountsPanel.initialLetter authorName) ]


{-| An author's avatar + name + Admin/Run Bots badges, linking to their
profile (see `href`) -- a `span` (not a link) if `maybeAuthor` is `Nothing`,
so the avatar still shows either way. Used by `Components.Posts`'
`postCard`/`postDetail`, `Components.PostReplies.replyCard`, and
`Shared.Breadcrumbs.replyCardView` -- `postDetail`'s is a plain, unwrapped
link (fine as-is); `postCard`'s needs the "stretched link" dance in its own
doc comment to keep this independently clickable without nesting an `<a>`
inside `postCard`'s own enclosing one.
