module Components.MultiMediaRenderer exposing (preview, previewExtraSmall, view)

{-| Renders a `Post`'s `media`. A single item (the common case) is the
"focus" of the post, so it's rendered big -- at its own inherent aspect
ratio (portrait, landscape, square, whatever), capped by reasonable bounds
rather than squashed into a fixed box (`.multi-media-single`/
`.multi-media-single-item` in `media.css`, `Components.MediaRenderer`'s
`Natural` sizing). Multiple items otherwise follow the post's own
`PostMediaLayout` (see `Components.Posts.mediaLayoutSelector`): the standard
`MEDIALAYOUTSTANDARD` layout is a horizontally-scrolling strip
(`.multi-media-strip`/`.multi-media-item`, the same horizontal-scroll pattern
as the Accounts Panel's `.servers-strip`) of thumbnails, each still at its
own aspect ratio, just capped to a small square (`Components.MediaRenderer`'s
`Compact` sizing) rather than stretched/cropped to a fixed size;
`MEDIALAYOUTDYNAMICVERTICALSCROLL` instead renders every item at the same big
`Natural` sizing as the single-item case, wrapping into a `space-around` grid
of rows (`.multi-media-gallery`/`.multi-media-gallery-item` in `media.css`,
which also breaks the grid out past the page's usual 800px column on wide
viewports) that scrolls vertically once it has more rows than fit -- a nicer
fit for a post that's meant to showcase several full-size images rather than
treat all-but-the-first as thumbnails. Only `view` (the full, non-preview
rendering used by `Components.Posts.postDetail`) honors the layout choice --
`preview`/`previewExtraSmall` (`Components.PostCard`'s compact cards,
`Shared.StarredPanel`'s rows) always use the standard strip regardless, since
a card's fixed-height layout has no room for a tall image gallery. Mirrors
the Tamagui app's `post_media_renderer.tsx`, minus its embed-link
(Twitter/Instagram/etc., which key off `Post.link` rather than `Post.media`)
handling.

{-| Same single-item-vs-scrolling-strip layout as `view`, just tighter
margins to fit in the middle of `Components.PostCard.postCard`'s compact
rendering (see `.multi-media-preview` in `media.css`, layered onto
`.multi-media-single`/`.multi-media-strip`'s own classes) -- and, for the
single-item case, `Compact` rather than `Natural` sizing (same as every
strip thumbnail already gets), since a post's full-size "focus" media would
dominate the card.

Left `pointer-events: auto` (see `.multi-media-preview`'s own doc comment) so
a video preview's native `controls` are directly clickable/playable rather
than falling through to `postCard`'s `.post-card-link-overlay` like
`.post-card-meta`'s plain text does.

preview : AccountsPanel.Server -> Maybe AccountsPanel.Account -> (String -> msg) -> List MediaReference -> Html msg
preview server maybeAccount onImageClicked media =
    render MEDIALAYOUTSTANDARD (Just MediaRenderer.Small) server maybeAccount onImageClicked media


{-| Same as `preview`, just with `MediaRenderer.ExtraSmall` sizing (half the
height of `preview`'s usual `Small`) -- for contexts even tighter on vertical
space than an ordinary post card, e.g. `Shared.StarredPanel`'s post rows.
-}
previewExtraSmall : AccountsPanel.Server -> Maybe AccountsPanel.Account -> (String -> msg) -> List MediaReference -> Html msg
previewExtraSmall server maybeAccount onImageClicked media =
    render MEDIALAYOUTSTANDARD (Just MediaRenderer.ExtraSmall) server maybeAccount onImageClicked media


{-| `Nothing` renders full-size (`view`); `Just sizing` renders as a preview
(`.multi-media-preview` layout) at `sizing`, used for both the single-item
case and every thumbnail in the scrolling strip -- `layout` is only ever
consulted in the `Nothing`/multi-item combination (see `view`'s own doc for
why `preview`/`previewExtraSmall` always pass `MEDIALAYOUTSTANDARD`
regardless of the post's actual choice). `onImageClicked` (fired with
a tapped image's `media.id`, see `Components.MediaRenderer`) is threaded
through unconditionally -- opening `Shared.MediaViewerPanel` on tap is the
same behavior everywhere a `Post`'s media renders, single item, strip, or
gallery.

The single-item case (and every item of a `MEDIALAYOUTDYNAMICVERTICALSCROLL`
gallery) uses `MediaRenderer.ToWidthAndHeight` (the usual default), but the
strip forces `MediaRenderer.ToWidth` instead -- every thumbnail in
`.multi-media-strip` ends up the same width regardless of its own aspect
ratio, rather than each capped independently and so varying in width across
the strip.
