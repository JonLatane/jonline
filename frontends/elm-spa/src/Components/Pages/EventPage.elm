{-| The shared guts of a single Event's detail/"invitation" view: the
`Event`'s own `Post` (title, link, media, content) up top, then a
horizontally-scrolling date-picker strip of the `Event`'s other
`Occasion`s (see `occasionHistoryView`) if it has more than one, then
the specific `Occasion` being viewed (its start/end time and location),
then that `Occasion`'s own optional override `Post`. Reused by both
`Pages.Event.PostId_` (`/event/:postId[@host]`) and
`Components.Pages.PostOrEventPage` (once a short-URL id resolves to an
Event/Occasion -- see that module's own doc), and, through it,
`Pages.UsernameOrCustomTab_` (once a segment starting with a reserved
short-URL character resolves this way -- see that module's `initEmbedded`).
Mirrors `Components.Pages.PostPage`'s own split from its two callers.

`postId` (passed to `init`, matching `Components.Pages.PostPage.init`'s own
`rawPostId` naming) is genuinely the viewed `Occasion`'s own `Post` id --
an `Occasion`'s identity is its own `Post`'s id (see
`Proto.Rellm.Occasion`). `GetEventsRequest.post_id` is the only way to
fetch a single Event (see `events.proto`), and looking it up by an
`Occasion`'s own Post id returns that occasion's whole parent `Event`
with _every_ one of its occasions, not just the one asked for -- which is
exactly what makes the date-picker strip possible without a second request.

`pageIsSecure`/`navKey` are captured once, at `init` (same reasoning as
`Components.Pages.PostPage.Model.pageIsSecure`/`navKey`) -- needed later by
`ConnectClicked` (`RellmServers.connectToRellmServer`) and `update`'s own
`Shared.GotEventDeleteResult`/`Shared.GotOccasionDeleteResult` handling
(navigating away once the viewed Event/occasion no longer exists), neither of
which otherwise has access to the calling page's own `Request`.

copies its own id (an `Occasion`'s identity, post-migration -- see this

in the strip -- `OnlyFuture` for an upcoming
occasion, `SinceTwoWeeksAgo` for one less than two weeks in the past,
`ShowAllOccasions` for anything older than that. Used by both
`clampHistoryDisplay` (to pick this page's own initial mode) and
`historyButtons` (to never offer a switch that would hide the very occasion
the page is showing) -- see either's own doc.

{-| Raises `model.occasionHistoryDisplay` up to `minimumHistoryDisplayFor
now occasion` if it's currently more restrictive than that -- never lowers
it, so this is safe to call every time the loaded `Event` changes
(`GotEvent`) without ever undoing a broader mode the user already switched
to via `historyButtonView`, whose button for any mode below that same
`minimumHistoryDisplayFor` floor is `disabled` rather than removed, so
there's no way to have reached one of those in the first place. In practice
this is what actually picks this page's initial mode: `init` always starts
`model.occasionHistoryDisplay` at `OnlyFuture` (the most restrictive
possible value) before the `Event` is known, so the first call once it
lands is the one that raises it to wherever the currently-viewed `occasion`
actually needs. `now` is `Shared.Model.time.now` -- see its own doc.

{-| Reconciles `occasionAnimations` with whichever of `event.occasions`
`model.occasionHistoryDisplay` currently selects -- newly-revealed occasions
(switching to a broader mode, e.g. `OnlyFuture` -> `ShowAllOccasions`) fade
in, newly-hidden ones (the reverse) fade/collapse out rather than just
vanishing, and the ones staying visible are left alone. A no-op while the
`Event` itself hasn't loaded yet. Mirrors
`Shared.MyMediaPanel.syncMediaAnimations` -- see its own doc; called from
every `update` branch that can change either input: `GotEvent` and
`HistoryDisplayChanged`. `now` is `Shared.Model.time.now` -- see its own doc.

{-| Scrolls `occasionStripDomId`'s strip horizontally so `occasionId`'s own
chip is centered in view -- fired both whenever a new `Occasion` becomes
"the current one" (a fresh page load, or the user clicking to a sibling
occasion's own page -- see `GotEvent`) and whenever `HistoryDisplayChanged`
reveals/hides other chips around it, potentially shifting its position.
`Process.sleep delayMs` first in both cases: measuring immediately would read
some chip's still-collapsed (`grid-template-columns: 0fr`, see `flip.css`)
0-width position rather than its real, grown-in one, since a chip's own
`UI.Flip.enter`/`remove` animation is still in progress at the moment either
caller's own model update lands -- `GotEvent` passes 300ms (every chip,
including ones that were already visible, starts a fresh `enter` whenever
`syncOccasionAnimations` rebuilds `occasionAnimations` from scratch, as it
does right after `GotEvent`), `HistoryDisplayChanged` passes 400ms (only the
chips actually entering/leaving are mid-animation, but there's usually more
of them sliding at once than a fresh page load ever has, so a little more
headroom). Either way this clears `flip.css`'s own 0.25s collapse/grow transition.
Silently gives up (`GotScrollTarget`'s `Err` case is a no-op) if the strip or
chip aren't found -- e.g. an `Event` with only one occasion, whose strip
`occasionHistoryView` doesn't render at all.

Only _measures_ here (`Dom.getElement`/`Dom.getViewportOf`) -- the actual
scroll happens back in `update`'s `GotScrollTarget` case, via
`Ports.scrollElementLeft` rather than `Dom.setViewportOf`. See that port's own
doc comment: `Dom.setViewportOf` always assigns `scrollLeft` from inside a
`requestAnimationFrame` callback, which silently fails to take effect at all
on an element with this strip's own `scroll-behavior: smooth` (see
`events.css`), even though the `Task` itself reports success -- confirmed by
instrumenting a real run (a `GotScrollTarget`-equivalent debug message
reported the correct computed target every time, yet `scrollLeft` never
budged) and reproducing it directly (`requestAnimationFrame(() => { el.scrollLeft
= x })`, checked a frame later, silently no-ops the same way). A port
callback is a plain (non-rAF-wrapped) JS callback, and doesn't have the
problem.

deleting one of its dates. Not tied to any one field (unlike title/link/

{-| Whether `occasion`'s own start/end time and location are safe to edit by
hand at all -- an occasion synced in from an ICS feed (`occasion.post.syncSource
/= Nothing`, set by `logic::sync_sources::event_sync::reconcile_occasions` when it creates
an occasion from a feed occurrence) has its `starts_at`/`ends_at`/`location`
silently overwritten back to the feed's own values on every subsequent sync
run (see that function's own `existing_occasion.starts_at != starts_at_db ||
...` check) -- exactly the same "would be clobbered on the next sync" problem
`editable`/`Events.hasIcsSyncSource` already guards title/link/content
against, just decided per-occasion rather than per-`Event`: an `Event` with a
sync source can still have manually-added occasions (via "Add More", which
never sets its occasion `Post`'s `syncSource`) safely alongside feed-sourced
ones, so this checks `occasion` itself rather than reusing `eventDetailView`'s
`editable`. Also gates `addMoreView`'s own button (see its own doc) -- "Add
More" duplicates `occasion`'s own `post`/`location` (see `buildRecurringOccasions`),
which reads as "add more dates like this synced one" in a way that doesn't
make sense for an occasion that isn't itself something the viewer set up by
hand.

{-| The "switch scope" buttons to show above the strip (see `historyButtonView`
for how the current one is highlighted instead of omitted, and how one more
restrictive than `minimumHistoryDisplayFor now occasion` -- which would hide
`occasion`, the very one this page is showing -- is disabled instead of
hidden). Normally all 3, but a mode is dropped entirely when its count ties a
strictly more restrictive mode's count -- since `OnlyFuture` ⊆
`SinceTwoWeeksAgo` ⊆ `ShowAllOccasions` (see `historyDisplayRank`), a tie
means the wider mode wouldn't reveal anything beyond what the narrower one
already shows, so offering it would just be a second button for the same set
of occasions (e.g. "1 date since 2 weeks ago" alongside "1 upcoming date"
when that's the same single occasion). `OnlyFuture` itself is never dropped
this way, since nothing is more restrictive than it. `now` is
`Shared.Model.time.now` -- see its own doc.

currently being viewed (`model.occasionId`). `currentOccasion` is that
currently-viewed occasion (see `occasionHistoryView`'s own `occasion`
parameter) -- passed through to `Components.Events.siblingOccasionWhenText`
so a sibling chip that shares `currentOccasion`'s own time-of-day can drop
its redundant time and show just the date(s). Wrapped in
`UI.Flip.itemAttributes` so it fades/collapses in and out as
`model.occasionHistoryDisplay` changes which occasions `occasionHistoryView`
selects (see `syncOccasionAnimations`).
