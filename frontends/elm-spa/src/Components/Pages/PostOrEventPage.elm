{-| A short Post/Event URL's own page: given a raw id (with no way to know up front whether it's a
plain `Post`'s own id or an `Event`/`Occasion`'s), resolves which one it is, then embeds the
same `Components.Pages.PostPage`/`Components.Pages.EventPage` either `Pages.Post.PostId_`/
`Pages.Event.PostId_` themselves mount -- so `/{postId}` (see `Pages.UsernameOrCustomTab_`'s own
doc for when this gets used instead of a plain username/custom-tab lookup) renders exactly the
same content as `/post/:id`/`/event/:id`, in place, without ever redirecting the address bar away
from the short URL.

Resolution is a `GetEvents{post_id}` fetch (`Components.Events.fetchEvent`, which already looks up
either an Event's own post or one of its Occasions' posts): on success, it's an Event; on
failure (e.g. `"event_not_found"` -- the id doesn't belong to any Event/Occasion at all), it's
tried as a plain Post instead. This means resolving an Event id takes two round trips total (one
here, one more inside `Components.Pages.EventPage.init` itself) -- a known, accepted inefficiency,
not a bug: `EventPage`/`PostPage`'s own `init` aren't designed to accept already-fetched data, and
teaching them to would be a much bigger change for a rarely-hit path (most links are either
`/post/:id` or `/event/:id` directly; this short form is a convenience alias).

{-| `rawSegment` is the short-URL route segment, still carrying its reserved leading character
(e.g. `:4rAfoSKAuJo`) -- that character only exists to tell `Pages.UsernameOrCustomTab_` apart from
a username/custom tab, and isn't part of the id itself (unlike base58, it's not even a valid
id character at all), so it's stripped here, once, before the actual id is used for anything --
every fetch/sub-page from this point on gets the real id, same as if `/post/:id`/`/event/:id` had
been visited directly.

exactly -- kicks off the disambiguating `GetEvents` fetch the first time `targetHost` is a known,
connected server, and no-ops (rather than erroring or blocking) until then; `update`'s `SharedMsg`
branch retries this on every incoming `Shared.Msg` while still `Resolving`, same as those two
pages' own `SharedMsg` handling does for their real fetch.

identical derivation exactly -- the resolving fetch must be authenticated the same way the real

visibility Event could resolve as "not found" here and get (wrongly) treated as a Post instead.
