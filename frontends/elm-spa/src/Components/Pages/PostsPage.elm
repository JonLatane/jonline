{-| The shared guts of a "recent posts" page: fetching recent posts from every
enabled server and rendering them with fade in/out animations, plus a
search box + POST/REPLY context chooser (see `searchRowView`) that switches
the fetch to `TEXT_SEARCH` (debounced 311ms after typing stops) and persists
`search_text`/`context` as URL query params -- reused by `Pages.Home_` (which
adds its own "Recent Posts" heading and passes `author = Nothing`) and
`Pages.UsernameOrCustomTab_.Posts`/`Pages.User.UserId_.Posts` (which pass the
already-resolved profile `User`, restricting the feed to that user's own
posts and adding this module's own "Posts | <name>" heading, via
`Components.Pages.UserProfilePage.nameHeader`), mirroring how
`Components.Pages.UserProfilePage` is reused by `Pages.UsernameOrCustomTab_` and
`Pages.User.UserId_` themselves.

fetch-and-store paths (`postsByServer`/`GotServerPosts`/`fetchNewServers`/`refetchServers` vs.
`federatedPosts`/`GotFederatedPosts`/`fetchFederatedPosts`) into one, since both are ultimately
"fetch some posts for a host key, store them under that key, let `syncAnimations` render them" --

`MastodonAccountFeed`/`BlueskyAuthorFeed` deliberately reuse the exact same `"mastodon:" ++
instanceHost`/`"bluesky:" ++ handle` shapes `MastodonInstance`/`BlueskyFeed` already use (rather than
some third, profile-specific prefix): the key doubles as every card's own `postServerHost` (see
`postCardView`), and clicking through to one of these posts individually needs to build an href
`Components.Users.parseFederatedUserId`/`Components.Posts.parseFederatedPostId` can actually parse
back -- both only ever look at the `"mastodon:"`/`"bluesky:"` prefix itself, so reusing it here is

account's token doesn't change without a full reconnect, which itself removes and re-adds the
account under a new key). `Nothing == Nothing` is exactly what makes `fetchNewFeeds` treat an
already-fetched federated source as unchanged forever -- except a *newly* added instance/account
(not yet a key in `postsByServer` at all) now gets picked up live by the same `Poll`/`SharedMsg`

refresh-and-retry, see that function's own doc) or exhausted its retry entirely (a `needsReauth`-worthy
failure, see `BlueskyAccounts.isReauthError`) -- either way something needs to reach
`Shared.AccountsPanel`'s own persisted `blueskyAccounts`, which this page has no direct write access
to. Piggybacks on the same `Maybe AccountsPanel.Msg` channel `fromServerResult` already uses for a
Rellm server's own token refresh, so `GotFeedPosts`'s handling doesn't need a federated-specific case.

heading (see `view`) -- `Pages.Home_` passes `Nothing`,
`Pages.UsernameOrCustomTab_.Posts`/`Pages.User.UserId_.Posts` pass their
already-resolved profile `User` paired with the host it was resolved from
(`Components.Users.Resolver`'s own `targetHost`, resolved before ever calling
this, so this module never needs to fetch the `User` itself -- it only needs
the host alongside it to look up that server's `RellmServer`/signed-in
`Account` for `authorHeadingView`'s avatar).

`navKey`/`path`, from the calling page's own `Request`, are what let
`searchRowView`'s search box/context chooser and `recentPostsTabsView`'s date
input persist `search_text`/`context`/`published_before` as URL query params
(see `pushUrl`) without this module needing to know which page-specific
`Gen.Params.*` type that `Request` is actually parameterized over -- every
caller's `Request.key`/`Request.url.path` fit this regardless. `query`, that
same `Request`'s already-parsed `.query`, seeds `searchText`/`context`/`tab`/
`publishedBefore` back out of the URL on load, so a shared/reloaded link
reproduces the same search/cutoff.

`embeddedPage` is `True` only for `Pages.Home_`'s and
`Components.Pages.UserProfilePage`'s own embedded copies -- see
`Model.embeddedPage`'s own doc.

`availableSyncDestinations` seeds `Model.availableSyncDestinations` directly -- `Nothing` for
every caller except `Components.Pages.UserProfilePage`, which passes `Just user.syncDestinations`.
Mirrors `Components.Pages.EventsPage.init`'s own trailing param exactly.

`profileFeedSource` seeds `Model.profileFeedSource` directly -- `Nothing` for every caller except
`Components.Pages.MastodonUserProfilePage`/`BlueskyUserProfilePage`, which pass `Just` a
`MastodonAccountFeed`/`BlueskyAuthorFeed` naming the one profile being viewed. See that field's own
doc for why this couldn't just reuse `author` instead.

{-| Every `FeedSource` this page should ever fetch from -- `relevantServers`' real Rellm servers
(unconditionally), plus every Mastodon instance being browsed/connected and every connected Bluesky
account, but only while the feed isn't scoped to one particular author (`model.author == Nothing`),
since neither Mastodon nor Bluesky supports the author-scoping a real `GetPosts` request does
(`fetchFeedSource` doesn't even attempt to send that for a `MastodonInstance`/`BlueskyFeed`), so
showing them on someone's profile page would be misleading -- they'd read as that person's own posts.

Deliberately *not* also gated on `model.embeddedPage`: that's `True` for both
`Components.Pages.UserProfilePage`'s embedded copy (already excluded above, since it's author-scoped)
and `Pages.Home_`'s "Recent Posts" widget (`model.author == Nothing`, exactly like the standalone
Posts page) -- Home's embedded copy has just as much claim to showing federated content as the
standalone page does, so there's nothing about `embeddedPage` alone that should exclude it. Text
search/`PostsBeforeDate` aren't a factor either way, on Home or the standalone page: a federated fetch
is never re-triggered by `applySearchChange`/`TabChanged` (see `refetchFeeds`'s own doc), so an
already-fetched federated post simply keeps showing, unfiltered by whatever search text is active --
an accepted first-pass limitation on the standalone page already, not a new one introduced here.

`model.profileFeedSource`, when set, overrides everything above outright -- `Components.Pages.MastodonUserProfilePage`/
`BlueskyUserProfilePage` embed this module purely to show one specific federated profile's own posts
(a `MastodonAccountFeed`/`BlueskyAuthorFeed`, see `Model.profileFeedSource`'s own doc), which has no
Rellm server of its own to resolve via `relevantServers` at all -- unlike `model.author`'s Rellm-only
author-scoping, there's exactly one source to ever fetch here, not "every relevant server plus zero
federated ones."

`Shared.Federation.Mastodon.fetchPosts`/`Shared.Federation.Bluesky.fetchPosts`. `BlueskyFeed` is the
one partial exception: a non-blank `model.searchText` switches it to `Bluesky.searchPosts` instead
(Bluesky's own real, network-wide search endpoint) -- the closest either federated source gets to a
real `GetPosts` request's own `TEXTSEARCH` mode. `MastodonInstance` has no search equivalent wired up
at all, so its fetch ignores `model.searchText` entirely. Every case funnels its result through the

{-| Fetches `sourcesToFetch` using the current `model.searchText`/`model.context` (for a `RellmServer`,
full author-scoped/search/context/cutoff support; for a `BlueskyFeed`, just `model.searchText`, see
`fetchFeedSource`'s own doc; meaningless to a `MastodonInstance`, which has no search of its own),
and drops any already-fetched source that's no longer `relevantFeedSources` -- shared by
`fetchNewFeeds` (which only passes the sources that actually need it, see its own doc comment) and
`applySearchChange` (which always passes every relevant server *and* Bluesky account, since a changed
search must re-fetch everything regardless of whether that source's acting account also happens to
have changed -- `MastodonInstance` sources are deliberately never included there, since they have no
server-side search at all, so re-fetching one on every keystroke would just be a wasted,
unfiltered-anyway request).

A source already `Loaded` under the _same_ acting account (see `feedSourceAccountId`) keeps showing
its last-known posts (`status` left untouched) while the re-fetch is in flight, rather than being
reset to `Loading` first -- `Loading` isn't rendered as its own state anywhere in this module, so the
only thing resetting it did was drop that source out of `syncAnimations`' `currentPosts`, which reads
as every one of its posts fading out and back in a moment later, even though `applySearchChange`'s
response usually still contains most of the same posts. See
`Components.Pages.EventsPage.refetchServers`'s own doc for where this was first diagnosed (a periodic
full-list flicker there) and ported from. A genuinely new source, or a `RellmServer` whose acting
account just changed (sign-in/out), still resets to `Loading` -- its previous posts (fetched under a
different or no account) are stale/invalid, not just "not yet refreshed," so they should disappear
rather than linger.

A no-op (nothing touched, no fetch fired) while `model.tab == PostsBeforeDate` and
`model.publishedBefore` is still `Nothing` -- mirrors `Components.Pages.EventsPage.refetchServers`'s
own guard on `model.endsAfter`: fetching with no real cutoff yet in hand would ask for `RecentPosts`'
full feed for the brief instant before `GotNow` resolves one, rather than just waiting.

{-| Drops posts for sources that are no longer relevant (so disabling a server, or removing a
browsed Mastodon instance/connected Bluesky account, hides its posts entirely), and re-fetches a
`RellmServer` whose acting account (the first enabled account signed into it, or anonymous) has
changed since the last fetch -- covering both disabling an account (falls back to anonymous) and
enabling a different one. A `MastodonInstance`/`BlueskyFeed` never has an "acting account" that can
change this way (see `feedSourceAccountId`), so this only ever re-fetches one of those the first time
it shows up as a key that isn't in `model.postsByServer` yet -- i.e. once, right after it's
added/connected, live while this page is already open, rather than waiting for a fresh visit.
Already-fetched-with-the-same-account sources are cheap to skip, so this is safe to call as often as
it likes.

This is event-driven -- any `AccountsPanel` message passing through `update`'s `SharedMsg` branch
triggers a call, since that covers server/account add/remove/enable/toggle and Mastodon/Bluesky
connect/browse/disconnect alike, including reconnecting persisted servers on app startup
(`Main.notifyPageOfSharedMsg` forwards those top-level `Shared` messages into whichever page is
active). `subscriptions`' poll is just a distrustful fallback in case some future state change
doesn't route through `SharedMsg`, so it can be slow.

ever creates top-level posts) are all left untouched.

`published_before` query params, via `replaceUrl` (not the navigation
function `pushUrl` -- editing the search box/date input shouldn't spam
browser history with one entry per debounce fire). Each omitted entirely
while at its default (blank search, `POST` context, `RecentPosts` tab), so
the common case keeps a clean URL. Query-string-only navigation like this
doesn't re-trigger this page's `init` -- see `Main.elm`'s `ChangedUrl`
handler, which only does that when `url.path` itself changes. Built as one
combined list (rather than each concern pushing its own `replaceUrl`
independently) because `Browser.Navigation.replaceUrl`/`Url.Builder.toQuery`
replace the _whole_ query string -- independent single-param pushes would
each silently wipe out whatever the others had just set. Mirrors
`Components.Pages.EventsPage.pushUrl`/`queryParams`.

{-| Identifies a post independently of which server/account fetched it, for

a unique dict key, not as a route.
-}
postAnimationKey : String -> Post -> String
postAnimationKey host post =
    host ++ "@" ++ post.id


{-| Reconciles `postAnimations` with the posts currently `Loaded` in `postsByServer` (real servers
and Mastodon/Bluesky feeds alike, now that both live in the same dict -- see `FeedSource`'s own doc):
starts a fade-in for newly-seen posts, a fade-out for posts that dropped out (rather than deleting
them outright), and un-interrupts a still-fading-out post that reappeared. Safe/cheap to call after
every `postsByServer` change, so `update` just calls it unconditionally wherever it might have
changed. `RemovePost` is what actually drops a gone post's animation entry once its fade-out
finishes. See `UI.Flip.syncAnimations` for the shared reconciliation logic this hands its own
`PostAnimation` shape to (mirrored by `Components.Pages.UsersPage.syncAnimations`).

Every `Loaded` list is filtered by `model.context` here regardless of source -- a no-op for a real
server's response (already scoped/filtered server-side to this exact request), but load-bearing for
a Mastodon/Bluesky feed, which has no notion of `model.context` at all: it's just whatever mix of
POST/REPLY the account's own feed happened to contain, so this is the one place that still has to
filter it by hand.

-- VIEW


{-| `showSearchRow` hides `searchRowView` (the search box + POST/REPLY context chooser together,
including its own trailing `exportButtonView`) when `False` -- used by `Pages.Home_`, which shows
its own `EventsPage`'s search box instead and keeps this module's `model.searchText` in sync with
it behind the scenes (see `Pages.Home_.update`'s cross-sync) rather than showing two redundant
boxes. Every other caller passes `True`, preserving the previous always-shown behavior.

A "Subscribe" link is exactly as useful without the search row as with it, though -- both
`Pages.Home_`'s embedded feed and `Components.Pages.UserProfilePage`'s own embedded posts list
(where `model.author` is already set, so `feedUrl` comes out `user_id`-scoped for free) still
want one. Since `showSearchRow = False` callers already render their own static heading
(`Pages.Home_.heading`/`Components.Pages.UserProfilePage.postsHeading`, both external to this
module -- see `recentPostsTabsView`'s own doc), `exportButtonView` is exposed for them to place
directly beside their own heading rather than this module inserting an otherwise-empty row of
its own for just that one button.

`showAuthorHeading` hides `authorHeadingView` (the "Posts | <name>" heading) when `False`
-- used by `Components.Pages.UserProfilePage`, which embeds this module a level below its own
already-shown username/avatar header (see `profileDetail`), so a second copy of the same name
would be redundant. Every other caller passes `True`, preserving the previous always-shown
(whenever `model.author` is `Just`) behavior.

`Components.Pages.EventsPage.tabsView`'s own look/structure), `RecentPosts`
(a plain pill button, carrying the same "Recent Posts"/"Recent Replies" label
`Pages.Posts`' own heading used to) and `PostsBeforeDate` (a `div` rather than
a `button`, since it nests a real `<input type="datetime-local">` and nesting
interactive content inside a `<button>` is invalid HTML) -- clicking either
(including anywhere in the second tab, to open the date input's native
picker, since the click still bubbles up to the wrapping `div`) or actually
changing the date both switch to it, per `TabChanged`'s own doc. Absent
entirely for `Pages.Home_`'s embedded copy (still gets its own static
"Recent Posts"/"Recent Replies" heading, see `Pages.Home_.heading`) and for
any author-scoped copy (`Pages.UsernameOrCustomTab_.Posts`/`Pages.User.UserId_.Posts`/

{-| Wraps `Posts.postCard` in a fading/scaling/collapsing animated `<div>`
(see `syncAnimations`) -- the `.flip-collapsed` class (present while
`entering` or `removing`) is what makes `flip.css`'s `.flip-animated-item`
rules grow/shrink this wrapper's own height, which is what makes the _other_
posts slide smoothly into the space this one leaves/needs, on top of its own
fade -- see that rule's doc comment for how. The inner `div` is purely a clip
layer (`.flip-animated-item > *` in `flip.css`, invisible/borderless) so the
inter-post spacing it holds as `padding-bottom` can shrink away smoothly
along with everything else, rather than showing up inside `.post-card`'s own
border; it also carries `pointer-events: none` while `removing` so a
fading-out card (e.g. from a just-disabled server) can't be clicked/starred
while it's on its way out.
