module Components.PostReplies exposing (Model, Msg, ReplyLoadStatus(..), init, refresh, subscriptions, update, view)

{-| Threaded replies for a single Post (see `Pages.Post.PostId_`) -- the
`Post` proto is itself recursive/graph-shaped via its own `replies` field (see
`Proto.Jonline.Post`'s doc comment), so `Model` just wraps a `root` Post and
tracks, per-node (`statuses`, keyed by Post id), whether that node's own
`replies` have been explicitly (re-)loaded via `GetPosts`'s `reply_depth`.

`init` eagerly loads the first few levels (`initialReplyDepth`) if `root`
didn't already come with `replies` attached (e.g. from a `GetPosts` call that
itself requested some `reply_depth`) -- from then on, an individual reply
whose own `replies` are incomplete (`replyCount` more than were returned --
see the proto doc comment: fewer than `replyCount` can come back if some are
hidden by moderation/visibility) gets its own "Load replies" button
(`Components.Posts.replyCard`), which fetches just that subtree
(`LoadRepliesClicked`).

The whole tree is flattened (`flattenReplies`) into a single depth-tagged list
for display -- a caller wanting an actually-nested visual layout still gets it
via each item's own `depth` (see `Components.Posts.replyCard`'s indentation)
rather than nested HTML, which is what lets the whole thing render as one flat,
FLIP-animated list (`UI.Flip`) the same way `Pages.Home_`'s recent-posts feed
and the Starred Posts panel already do for their own (non-nested) post lists.

{-| Per-node (keyed by Post id) reply-loading state -- `ReplyLoaded` suppresses
`Components.Posts.replyCard`'s "Load replies" button even if `replyCount` still disagrees with
the actual `replies` array size (moderation/visibility can hide some -- see
this module's doc comment), since that mismatch is then expected rather than
"not loaded yet".

{-| One flattened reply's own FLIP animation state, alongside the `Post`/
`depth` it was flattened at -- mirrors `Pages.Home_`'s `PostAnimation`

{-| Sets up a fresh `Model` for `post` (the Post currently being viewed, e.g.
`Pages.Post.PostId_`'s own `PostLoaded` post) on `host` -- if it already came
with `replies` attached, those are used as-is; otherwise, if it has any
replies at all (`replyCount`/`responseCount` > 0), kicks off a fetch
`initialReplyDepth` levels deep.

{-| Re-fetches `root`'s own direct replies (unconditionally, `initialReplyDepth`
deep again) -- for `Pages.Post.PostId_` to call once the Markdown panel reports
a successful save: either `root`'s content just changed, or (more relevantly
here) a brand new reply to it was just posted, and needs to show up. Any
deeper subtree a user had individually expanded past `initialReplyDepth` (via
`LoadRepliesClicked`) gets collapsed back down by this, same trade-off
`PostId_`'s old flat `refetch` already made for the (until now, single-level)
replies list.

{-| Replaces the node matching `targetId` anywhere in `post`'s own tree with

particular reply (or `root` itself) back into the tree it came from, without
disturbing any of that node's siblings/ancestors/already-loaded cousins.

{-| Depth-first, pre-order flattening of `post`'s own reply tree (not
including `post` itself -- the page already shows that via its own
`postDetail`) -- direct replies at depth 1, their own replies at depth 2, etc.
This (not `Dict` iteration order, which is alphabetical by id) is what decides
the on-screen order every list/animation below actually renders in.

A reply whose id is in `collapsedReplies` (see `Model.collapsedReplies`,
toggled by its own `replyStatusButton`) still appears itself, but its
descendants are skipped -- `syncAnimations` then sees them drop out of the
flattened tree and fades them out via `Flip.remove` exactly like it would for
a reply that stopped coming back from the server, giving the collapse/expand
toggle its animation for free.

            )


{-| Reconciles `replyAnimations` with `model.root`'s current flattened tree --
starts a fade-in for newly-seen replies, a fade-out for any that dropped out
(e.g. a reply subtree collapsed back down by `refresh`), and un-interrupts a
still-fading-out reply that reappeared -- same reconciliation
`Pages.Home_.syncAnimations` does for its own recent-posts feed. Safe/cheap to
call after every change to `model.root`, so `update`/`init` just call it
unconditionally.

{-| Renders `model`'s whole (flattened) reply tree as one FLIP-animated list
(see `syncAnimations`) -- `text ""` if there are none. `onReplyClicked`/
`onEditClicked` build this page's own reply-composing/editing messages for a
given reply Post (same as `postDetail`'s own `onEditClicked`); `onMediaClicked`
likewise takes the reply itself so a click can be attributed to the right
Post. `toMsg` wraps this module's own `Msg` into the caller's.
