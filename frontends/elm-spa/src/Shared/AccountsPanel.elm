`setServerField`, a successful `GotAuthResult`), `server`/`username` are read
from here rather than `accountForm`, same reasoning as `PendingCreateAccount`.

`acceptedAt` is the click time of "Accept and Continue" itself, captured via

read or write anything -- see `serverFeedItemSortOrderSpace`/`accountItemSortOrderSpace`, the two

`PushSubscriptionCheck`'s `publicKey` needs to match against are usually still reconnecting (no
`RellmServer.connected` yet) at the moment `checkPushSubscription`'s result actually comes back, so the
very first attempt almost always finds nothing. A no-op once there's nothing pending, or once a
match has already been dispatched -- cheap enough to run unconditionally alongside
`syncItemAnimations`/etc.

Doesn't just trust every matching account straight into `pushSubscriptions` -- the browser's
subscription only proves _some_ account on this server is registered for it, not which ones (see
`GetPushSubscriptionStatus`'s own RPC doc comment) -- so instead this fires one verification call
per matching account and lets `GotPushSubscriptionStatusResult` fill in `pushSubscriptions` only
for the ones the server actually confirms.

clearing whenever the field changes for _any_ reason: typing

picking a new main server (`MainServerSelected`). Also resets

refreshed from the response too (not just assumed unchanged), same as the original connect flow --

{-| `RellmAccounts.refreshPermissionsTask` for every account on the given server that isn't
already known to need a password -- not just enabled (signed-in) ones, so a
disabled account's access token is refreshed (and `needsPassword` discovered)
right along with everyone else's, rather than only once the user re-enables
it.

Skips accounts already flagged `needsPassword` -- their refresh token is
already known to be dead, and retrying it on every single reconnect (app
startup/reload, this same function's own other callers) would just fail the
exact same way every time while persisting/broadcasting a no-op change --
effectively a boot loop on every future load. The only way out of
`needsPassword` is a fresh login (`PasswordNeededClicked` -> `GotAuthResult`),
which doesn't go through here at all.

Runs every account's refresh as one batch, settling into a single
`GotServerPermissionsRefresh` once _all_ of them finish, rather than each
independently dispatching (and persisting the result of) its own
`GotPermissionsRefresh` -- so a server with several accounts produces one
`persist` (and cross-tab broadcast -- see `Ports.persistAccountsAndServers`)
instead of one per account. Two tabs both reconnecting to the same servers at
startup would otherwise each re-broadcast every single account's result as it
trickles in, each broadcast in turn nudging the _other_ tab's own
`AccountsAndServersBroadcastReceived` -- see `Model.accessTokenRefreshChecked`,
which defers this even further, into one `persist` for the whole startup
sweep.

`accessTokenRefreshChecked`/`finishStartupUnit`) -- otherwise every
individual reconnect/account-refresh that happens to land before then would
each write (and broadcast to every other open tab) their own sliver of
still-converging state, rather than the one coherent snapshot this waits for.
Anything that changes in the meantime (a user actually doing something in the
brief window before the sweep settles, vs. the sweep's own churn) still shows
up on screen immediately either way -- `model` itself is never gated, only
writing it out -- and gets swept up into that same first `persist` once

from `pendingServerChecks` has finished, flips `accessTokenRefreshChecked`.

accumulated during the sweep in one write (see `persist`'s own doc); or the
sweep was already long done (ordinary steady-state operation -- e.g. a server
added well after startup, via `AccountsAndServersBroadcastReceived` or the Add
Server form), where `persist` behaves exactly as it always has, once per
call. Only skips persisting in between those two: this unit finished, but
others are still pending, so `persist` would just no-op anyway (see

{-| Like `RellmAccounts.performWithRellmAccount`, but takes a `MaybeAccountServer` (resolved
fresh against `model`) instead of a live `RellmAccount`, and requires that it
resolve to one -- fails with `Grpc.NetworkError` if `host` isn't a known
server, or if no matching account is found (both meaning the caller
shouldn't have gotten this far; see e.g. `Shared.MarkdownPanel.resolve`'s
own pre-flight, user-facing gating). `req` gets the resolved `RellmServer` (for
`Grpc.setHost`) and access token string. Returns an already-built `Msg` to
dispatch (via whatever out-msg/`Effect` mechanism the caller already uses
for e.g. `Shared.AccountsPanelMsg`) if a token refresh happened, `Nothing`
otherwise -- callers never see the raw `AccessTokenResponse`.

{-| Like `performWithAccountServer`, but the account is optional: with a
`MaybeAccountServer` that resolves to a known account, authenticates
(refreshing first if needed) exactly like `performWithAccountServer`; with
`( Nothing, host )` (or a `userId` that doesn't resolve to an account),
performs `req` anonymously (no authorization header). Fails with
`Grpc.NetworkError` only if `host` itself isn't a known server.
