module Shared.Breadcrumbs exposing (BreadcrumbRoot(..), Model, Msg(..), bar, init, replyPanel, update)

{-| A trail of "how did I get here" chips shown at the bottom of the top nav
(see `UI.headerNav`), for a Post reached by following a chain of replies (and,
eventually, Event/Event Instance discussions) rather than directly: the root
thing's own title/name, then one avatar+username chip per reply on the way to
whichever Post is currently being viewed. Tapping any chip opens `replyPanel`,
a popup anchored just under the trail itself showing that chip's own Post --
so jumping back to an ancestor reply doesn't require actually navigating to
its own page. The open chip is tinted with `model.host`'s own
`background-color-primary` (see `UI.EmittedStylesheet`), so it's clear which
segment `replyPanel` is currently showing.

Wired into `Shared.Model`/`UI.elm` the same way `Shared.MarkdownPanel` is: one
shared instance, populated contextually by whichever page has a chain to show
(currently just `Pages.Post.PostId_`, via `SetRoot`) rather than each page
owning its own breadcrumb state.

`FromPost` and `FromServerHost` are rendered -- `FromEvent` (an Event
Instance's discussion, reached the same way) is a real variant already so
callers/`Model` don't need to change shape again once it's wired up, but its
`rootSegment`/its own ancestor-fetching aren't implemented yet.

`FromServerHost` is the odd one out: it isn't reached via a chain of replies
at all (see `SetRoot`'s own doc) -- `Pages.Home_` sets it to
`AccountsPanel.mainFrontendHost` since its feed isn't scoped to any one
server, just so the trail still shows _something_ identifying "home". A
`serverSegment` chip (server logo + name) is also what gets prepended at the
left of the trail on `FromPost`/`FromEvent` roots whenever `Model.host` isn't
`mainFrontendHost` -- see `bar`.

{-| The horizontally-scrollable trail itself -- empty (`text ""`) if no page
has set a `root` right now, or if there'd be nothing worth showing even with
one: no `replies` (so no actual reply chain to trace back through) on
`mainFrontendHost` (so there's no `hostSegment` server chip to show either --
see its own doc) leaves just a single "home" chip that says nothing a viewer
doesn't already know, e.g. `Pages.Home_`'s own `FromServerHost
mainFrontendHost` root, or a plain top-level Post that happens to already be
on `mainFrontendHost`. Mounted at the bottom of `.navbar` (see
`UI.headerNav`), not as a floating panel like `replyPanel` below.

whenever `model.host` (the server every segment below actually lives on)
isn't `accountsPanelModel.mainFrontendHost` -- e.g. a reply chain or root Post
reached on a server other than the one "driving" the rest of the UI's chrome,
so it's clear which server this whole trail belongs to before ever reaching
`rootSegment` itself. A list so `bar` can just concat it onto the front of
the segments it interspersed with separators -- empty (no chip, no extra
separator) either when there's nothing to disambiguate, or when `root` is
already `FromServerHost` (`Pages.Home_`'s own root, always set to
`mainFrontendHost` -- see `Pages.Home_`), which would otherwise render this
same chip twice.

initial-letter placeholder, mirroring `segmentAvatar` below) followed by the
server's own branding name, clipped to one line with an ellipsis (see
`.breadcrumb-server` in nav.css). Deliberately not
`AccountsPanel.serverNameAndLogo` -- that splits a server's name into an
emoji "badge" plus a fuller secondary line across two rows for the Accounts
Panel's own (much roomier) chips, which doesn't fit the trail's tight single
line. Always tinted with `host`'s own `background-color-primary` (see
`UI.EmittedStylesheet`), unconditionally rather than only while some segment
is `viewing` (contrast `segmentClasses`) -- there's no "open" state for this
chip, it's just always this server's own color. Renders nothing if `host`
isn't a known `AccountsPanel.Server` yet (e.g. still being resolved).
