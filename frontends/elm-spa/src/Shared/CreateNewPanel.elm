module Shared.CreateNewPanel exposing (Mode(..), Model, Msg(..), eligibleAccounts, hasEligibleAccount, init, isOpen, update, view)

{-| A single, app-wide "New Post"/"New Event" composer -- title (the only
field required in both modes), an optional link, optional media (picked via
`Shared.MyMediaPanel`'s `MultiSelect` mode), and optional Markdown content
(edited via `Shared.MarkdownPanel`, shown here only as a rendered preview + an
Edit button), plus -- in `EventMode` only -- a required start/end date/time
pair. Wired into `Shared.Model`/`UI.elm` the same way `Shared.MarkdownPanel`/
`Shared.MyMediaPanel` are, but toggled open/closed like the Accounts/Starred
Posts panels (`ToggleOpen`) rather than opened for a specific already-in-hand
entity -- there's no Post/Event yet, this panel _is_ the not-yet-created
draft.

`Model.mode` (switched via the header's "New Post"/"New Event" tabs, see
`modeTabsView`) picks which RPC `SaveClicked` actually calls
(`Jonline.createPost` vs `Jonline.createEvent`) and which permission
(`CREATEPOSTS` vs `CREATEEVENTS`) gates `postingAsSelector`/`resolve` --
title/link/media/content are shared by both modes, submitted as-is either as
the Post itself (`PostMode`) or as the `Event`'s own underlying Post
(`EventMode`). An `EventMode` save always creates exactly one `EventInstance`
(`startsAt`/`endsAt`, the two extra fields), with no `Post` of its own --
its `visibility` is inherited from the `Event`'s own Post by the backend
(`create_event.rs`) leaving `EventInstance.post` unset, so there's nothing
else for this panel to set on it.

Cancel/the shared backdrop/`CloseAllPanels` all just close this panel
(`CloseClicked`) without touching any of the draft fields -- the draft is
retained across opens until an actual `SaveClicked` succeeds, so accidentally
tapping outside or hitting Cancel can't lose it.

Since editing the Markdown content or picking media both hand off to another
app-wide panel (`Shared.MarkdownPanel`/`Shared.MyMediaPanel`) rather than
embedding their own editor/picker here, `update` returns not just a possible
`AccountsPanel.Msg` to forward (same convention as every other panel here,
for a token refresh mid-save) but also a possible `MarkdownPanel.Msg`/
`MyMediaPanel.Msg` -- `EditContentClicked`/`EditMediaClicked`'s own request to
actually open one of those, for `Shared.update` to dispatch on this panel's
behalf (it can't do so directly without importing `Shared`, which would
cycle). Their own results flow back the same way every other cross-panel
result does here: `Shared.update`'s own `MarkdownPanelMsg`/`MyMediaPanelMsg`
branches recognize a save meant for this panel and feed it back in via
`ContentSaved`/`MediaSaved`, rather than this module reaching into either
panel's state directly.
