module Shared.MarkdownPanel exposing (Model, Msg(..), TargetType(..), ViewMode, init, subscriptions, update, view)

{-| A single, app-wide Markdown editor: a plain monospace `<textarea>` and a
live `Components.Markdown.view` preview of the same text, with "Save"/
"Cancel" actions below. Shown side by side, or either alone, per `ViewMode`
(a 3-position slider in the header lets the user pick -- see `modeSlider`),
since a 50/50 split doesn't leave enough room for either half on a
phone-width screen. Wired into `Shared.Model`/`UI.elm` the same way
`Shared.AccountsPanel`/`Shared.StarredPanel` are -- one shared instance,
opened from wherever it's needed (see `TargetType`) rather than each caller
owning its own editor state.

Knows how to edit/submit a `Proto.Jonline.Post`'s `content` (via `TargetType`)
-- editing a `Post` already in hand (`PostContent`), or composing a brand new
reply to one (`NewReply`) -- or a `Proto.Jonline.User`'s `bio` (`UserBio`, see
`Components.UserProfilePage`). More `TargetType` constructors can be added
later without touching callers that only care about the ones they use.

    | NoOp


{-| What a save should do once the user's done editing: `PostContent post`
overwrites `post`'s own content (via `UpdatePost`, re-fetching `post` fresh
first -- see `saveTask` -- so a stale in-hand copy can't clobber any of its
other fields, e.g. `visibility`, that changed server-side since this panel was
opened); `NewReply post` creates a brand new reply to `post` (via `CreatePost`,
`reply_to_post_id = post.id`), copying `post`'s own `visibility` for the new
reply; `UserBio user` overwrites `user`'s own `bio` (via `Users.updateUser`,
which does the same re-fetch-then-overwrite dance as `PostContent`).
`ServerDescription`/`ServerPrivacyPolicy`/`ServerMediaPolicy server` overwrite
just that one field of `server`'s `ServerInfo` (via `ConfigureServer`,
re-fetching the server's configuration fresh first -- see `saveTask` --
same reasoning as `PostContent`, and the same pattern
`Shared.AccountsPanel.renameServer` already uses for `name`). Only ever
opened for a signed-in account with `ADMIN` on that server (see `resolve`).

`SendNewMessage` composes a brand new `Message` (via `SendMessage`, see
`sendMessageTask` -- deliberately _not_ routed through `saveTask`/`resolve`'s
shared per-target dispatch, since it's the one target needing more than
`model.content` to submit). Its own extra draft state (who to send as, who to
send to) doesn't fit in a bare `content : String` either, so it lives in
`Model.messageSubject`/`.messageRecipients` instead, and its own chrome
replaces the plain `accountRow`/adds a fields block below it -- see
`accountRowFor`/`extraFieldsView`, the two extension points any future
`TargetType` needing its own top-chrome beyond the text/preview editor should
hook into, rather than special-casing `view` itself further. Its own payload
(unlike every other `TargetType`, which either carries no payload or an
existing entity to overwrite) is the recipients to pre-seed
`messageRecipients` with when this panel opens (`Open`, below) -- `[]` for a
fresh compose (`Pages.Messages`' own "Send Message" button), or a messaging
group's current members, minus whoever's sending, for "Reply"
(`MessagesPage.ReplyClicked`) -- either way just the _initial_ selection,
freely changed from the picker afterward like any other.

{-| Needs `AccountsPanel.Model` (to resolve `targetHost` to a connected

that they're actually usable) and can itself surface an `AccountsPanel.Msg` it
needs forwarded on its behalf -- an `AccessTokenResponseReceived`, if
`saveTask` had to refresh the account's token, that `AccountsPanel.performWithAccountServer`
already builds -- for `Shared.update` to actually dispatch, same convention as
`Shared.StarredPanel.update` -- paired, in that same third-tuple-slot
convention, with a `Bool` that's `True` only right after a `saveTask`-driven
save succeeds (`GotSaveResult`, never `GotSendMessageResult`, see that
branch's own doc): `Shared.update` fires `Shared.ShowScrollPreserver` on it,
since the edited Post's re-fetched content (see `saveTask`) can change its
rendered height once this panel closes and the page under it catches up,
same yank `Shared.ShowScrollPreserver` already guards against on back
navigation -- and a third `Bool`, `True` only right after `CancelClicked`, for
`Shared.update` to turn into a `Shared.RequestDelete ConfirmMarkdownEditingDataLost`
(see `Msg`'s own doc on `CancelClicked`/`CancelConfirmed`).

keypress bubbles up from the `textarea` or from a button) rather than
globally, so neither shortcut fires unless this panel's actually open
(`model.target /= Nothing`) and only one save/cancel at a time

`disabled` condition in spirit, though it doesn't re-check `canSave`/`resolve`
here since `SaveClicked` (see `update`) already re-checks that itself and
surfaces any problem as `errorMessage`.

target renders nothing here.

The Subject field itself is hidden behind a "…" toggle
(`subjectToggleButton`) just left of the "To" label rather than shown
outright -- most messages don't need one, and burying it saves the vertical
space `markdown-panel-message-fields`'s own `max-height` (markdown_panel.css)
has to share with the recipients picker below it. `SubjectToggleClicked`
flips `model.messageSubjectExpanded`; the subject text itself
(`model.messageSubject`) is untouched by hiding it again, so toggling back

`ADMIN` for `UserBio` (matching `backend/src/rpcs/users/update_user.rs`'s own

the RPC) and by `view` (to show the same problem inline, and disable Save,

by both `view` (`errorMessage`/`canSave`) and `SaveClicked`, same

`UpdatePost` -- only `content` from `model.content` is overlaid onto that fresh
copy, so any of its other fields (`visibility`, `media`, ...) that changed
server-side since this panel opened aren't clobbered by a stale in-hand
snapshot (`UpdatePost` takes -- and unconditionally applies -- a whole `Post`,
see `backend/src/rpcs/posts/update_post.rs`). `NewReply` has no such race to
guard against -- it's creating a brand new Post, not overwriting an existing
one -- so it submits straight from the `post` it was opened with. `UserBio`
does the same re-fetch-then-overwrite dance as `PostContent`, via
`Users.updateUser`. Only a `Msg` to dispatch (if a token refresh happened) is
returned -- none of these three cases' updated entities are used by any
caller (see `Pages.Post.PostId_`/`Components.UserProfilePage`'s
`GotSaveResult` handling, which just refetches their own copy on success).

{-| `SendNewMessage`'s own save -- unlike every `saveTask` branch above, needs
more than `target`+`content` (`recipientUserIds`, `subject`), so it isn't one
of those; `SaveClicked` calls this directly instead. No re-fetch-then-overlay
dance (unlike `PostContent`/`UserBio`) -- there's nothing existing to
overwrite, this always creates a brand new `Message`. Unlike every `saveTask`
branch (which discard their own RPC's response, `Task.map Tuple.first`ing it
away), this keeps both the response `Message` itself *and* `server.frontendHost`
-- `SendMessage` is the one save whose caller (`Components.Pages.MessagesPage`,
via `GotSendMessageResult`) needs to know exactly what got created and where,
to navigate/scroll to it; `Message` has no host of its own to recover that
from afterward (it's purely an Elm-side routing concept), so it has to be
captured here, at the one point this task actually knows which server it
talked to.

{-| Shared by `ServerDescription`/`ServerPrivacyPolicy`/`ServerMediaPolicy` --
re-fetches `server`'s configuration fresh (`GetServerConfiguration`) and
overlays just `updateInfo`'s change onto its `serverInfo` before writing the
whole thing back (`ConfigureServer`), same fetch-then-overlay-then-write
pattern (and the same reasoning -- not clobbering a concurrent config change
made elsewhere) as `Shared.AccountsPanel.renameServer`. Unlike the other
`saveTask` cases, the resulting `Msg` isn't just a possible token refresh --
it's `AccountsPanel.GotServerConfigSaveResult`, which patches the freshly
written `ServerConfiguration` straight into `Shared.AccountsPanel.Model.servers`
(keyed by `server.frontendHost`) so `Components.Pages.ServerInformationPage`'s
view picks up the change without a separate refetch of its own. A token
refresh happening during this exact save (rare -- see `performWithAccountServer`)
is deliberately not separately propagated here; the next authenticated request
on this server just refreshes again.
