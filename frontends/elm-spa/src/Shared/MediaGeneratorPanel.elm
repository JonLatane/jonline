{-| A single, app-wide AI image generation panel -- opened contextually (a Post/Event's own
"Generate Media…" button, next to its existing "Edit Media…" -- see `Components.Posts.postDetail`/
`Pages.Event.EventId_`), the same "one shared instance, `Nothing`/`""` means closed" convention
`Shared.MarkdownPanel`/`Shared.MyMediaPanel` already use. Shaped like `MarkdownPanel` (a prompt to
edit, Save/Cancel below), but with three inputs instead of one: which of the caller's
`AvailableAIModel`s to call (`modelChooserView`), the editable prompt (`promptView`), and a set of
reference media (`mediaSectionView`) -- reusing `Shared.MyMediaPanel`'s own `MultiSelect` chooser
for the last, the same picker Post/Event editing already uses for their own `media`, rather than
building a second one.

In terms of z-axis (see `media_generator_panel.css`), this sits just *below* `Shared.MyMediaPanel`
-- deliberately, since `EditMediaClicked` (below) opens that panel over this one to pick reference
media, and it should visibly win that overlap the same way every other "panel opens a picker over
itself" pair in this app does (`Shared.CreateNewPanel`'s own Edit Media button, `Pages.Post.PostId_`'s).
That reuse means this panel can't consume `MyMediaPanel`'s `SaveMediaClicked`/`CloseClicked`
directly the way a *page* would (via its own `SharedMsg`/`fromShared`, gated on a page-level
"am I mid-edit" flag) -- since this panel itself lives in `Shared.Model`, not a page, that
gating instead happens one level up, in `Shared.update`'s own `MyMediaPanelMsg` case, mirroring
exactly how it already lets `Shared.CreateNewPanel` do the same (see `MediaSaved`/`MediaEditClosed`
below, and `Shared.update`'s own doc on why).

Once generation succeeds, this panel closes itself and the resulting `GotGenerateResult` is left to
bubble up as an ordinary `Shared.Msg` -- `Main.notifyPageOfSharedMsg` already forwards every
`Shared.Msg` to whichever page is current regardless of who opened this panel, so the page that
opened it (`Components.Pages.PostPage`/`Pages.Event.EventId_`) just matches on this exact message in
its own `SharedMsg` handling, gated on its own "did I open this" flag (mirrors `mediaEditActive`), to
refetch and pick up the newly attached `Media` -- see those modules' own `GenerateMediaClicked`/
`SharedMsg` handling.

attaching it to anything. `TargetEvent` carries both the `Event` and the specific `EventInstance`
being viewed (`Pages.Event.EventId_`'s own `instance`) purely so `targetCardView` can render the
same `Components.Events.eventCard` that page already shows elsewhere -- generation itself only ever
targets the Event's own Post (see `ai_model_providers.proto`'s own doc on `GenerateMediaRequest.target`),
never a particular instance.

{-| Needs `AccountsPanel.Model` for the same reasons `Shared.MarkdownPanel.update` does --
resolving `targetHost` to the signed-in `Account` to submit as (`resolve`), and (here) also to look
up `Account.availableAiModels` for `ModelSelected`/`Open`'s own default pick. The extra
`Maybe MyMediaPanel.Msg` mirrors `Shared.CreateNewPanel.update`'s own `EditMediaClicked` request --
this panel can't dispatch `MyMediaPanel.Open` directly without importing `Shared`, which would
cycle, so `Shared.update` does it on this panel's behalf (see module doc).

with a signed-in `Account` -- mirrors `Shared.MarkdownPanel.resolve`/`Shared.MyMediaPanel.resolve`
exactly (no per-`Target` permission branching needed here, unlike `MarkdownPanel`'s own `resolve`:
this panel's targets have no client-checkable permission beyond "signed in on that server", the
actual author-or-Admin/owner-or-grantee checks all happen server-side, in `GenerateMedia` itself).
