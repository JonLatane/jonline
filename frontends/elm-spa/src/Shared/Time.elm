{-| The app-wide notion of "when is it right now", from the viewer's own
point of view -- see `Shared.Model.time`.

`browserTimeZone` is used everywhere a `Post`/`User` timestamp is displayed
(see `formatDate`/`formatDateTime`/`formatMoment`/etc. below) so those
render in the viewer's own local time rather than the server's UTC.

`now` is captured once via `Time.now` in `Shared.init` (mirrors
`browserTimeZone.zone`'s own `getBrowserZone` capture exactly, including the
`Time.millisToPosix 0` placeholder until it resolves) -- the single app-wide
"now" every page that used to capture its own (`Pages.Event.EventId_`'s
date-picker strip categorizing `EventInstance`s as upcoming/past,
`Components.Events.eventCard`/`instanceWhenText`'s "is this date in the
viewer's current year" check) reads instead, rather than each independently
re-running `Task.perform ... Time.now`. Deliberately _not_ kept live via a
`Time.every` tick -- every current use only needs "roughly what day/year is
it" for the length of a single page view, not a ticking clock, the same
tolerance `Pages.Event.EventId_.Model.now`'s own doc already accepted before
this moved here. `Components.Pages.EventsPage.Model.endsAfter`/
`Components.Pages.PostsPage.Model.publishedBefore` are deliberately
untouched by this -- those are live request cursors (polled and
user-editable), not a display "what time is it", and already document why
they're their own thing.

Bundled into one type, rather than `browserTimeZone`/`now` staying separate
`Shared.Model` fields, since almost every call site that needs one needs the
other too -- see `formatMoment`/`formatRange`/`formatDateRange` below, each
of which takes the pair together rather than as two separate arguments.
`formatDate`/`formatDateTime` (which only ever need `browserTimeZone`, not
`now`) keep taking `BrowserTimeZone`/`Time.Zone` alone rather than a full
`Model`, so callers that only have the timezone half (there are none today,
but nothing here should force one into existing) aren't forced to fabricate
a `now`.

-}
type alias Model =
    { browserTimeZone : BrowserTimeZone
    , now : Time.Posix

{-| The browser's local timezone, plus its short display name (e.g. "EDT",
"GMT+2") and whether its locale renders a time of day in 24-hour form.
Bundled together since every call site that needs one of these tends to need
the others too -- see `Model.browserTimeZone`.

`zone` is resolved via `Shared.getBrowserZone` once `Shared.init`'s `Cmd`
runs -- `Time.utc` until then (never visibly wrong for long: the `Task`
resolves on the same frame the app first renders). Unlike plain `Time.here`,
`getBrowserZone` is DST-aware (backed by `justinmimbs/timezone-data`), so a
timestamp far from "now" -- e.g. a recurring `EventInstance` on the other
side of a DST transition -- still converts with the offset that actually
applied on _its_ date, not today's. `abbreviation`/`uses24Hour` both come from a
different source: unlike `zone`, `elm/time` has no way to derive either (a
`Time.Zone` is just a raw offset table, with no notion of a locale's
formatting conventions), so both are read once at startup from the browser's
own `Intl` API as plain flags (see `index.html`) rather than a port
round-trip -- they only matter at the instant a timestamp renders, same as
`zone`, and aren't worth keeping live across a session. `abbreviation` is
`""` (never shown), `uses24Hour` is `False`, if their respective `Intl`
lookups fail for any reason.

{-| A plain `YYYY-MM-DD` rendering of a timestamp in `zone` -- e.g. a

infrastructure exists in this app yet, so this keeps things simple rather
than introducing one. Takes a bare `Time.Zone` rather than a full
`BrowserTimeZone` since, unlike `formatDateTime`, it has no time-of-day
component for `abbreviation` to disambiguate.

reader can tell which zone `HH:mm` is in without guessing -- for timestamps
where the time of day actually matters but a human-friendly `formatMoment`
would be overkill (e.g. `Components.Pages.UserProfilePage`'s Event Sync Source last-synced time),

supplies the viewer's own "current year"/"current day", so `dateLabel` can
drop a redundant year or add a "Today"/"Yesterday"/"Tomorrow" prefix (see
its own doc). Used by `Components.Events.instanceWhenText` for an
`EventInstance` with only a `startsAt` or only an `endsAt` (unusual --
normally both are set, see `formatRange`), and by `Components.Posts.whenText`
for a `Post`'s created/updated/published timestamps.

behind `Components.Events.instanceWhenText`'s "August 1, 6-7PM" /
"June 1, 10PM - June 8, 3AM" / "December 31, 2025, 9PM - January 1, 2AM"
formatting (see that function's own doc for the full set of examples this is
designed against). `time.now` supplies the viewer's own "current year"/"current
day" so `dateLabel` can drop a redundant year, or add a
"Today"/"Yesterday"/"Tomorrow" prefix, on either side (see its own doc) --
except when that would print both "Today" and "Yesterday", or both "Today"
and "Tomorrow" (e.g. an overnight range from yesterday into today, or today
into tomorrow): since `start` is never later than `end`, those are the only
two relative-day pairings a two-sided range can ever produce, and stating
both is redundant once one side is already anchored as "Today" -- so the
non-"Today" side falls back to its plain `dateLabel` (see `rangeDateLabels`).

Same calendar day (in `time.browserTimeZone.zone`): a single `dateLabel`
followed by both times, merged onto one `-`-joined range (see
`timeRangeLabel`) -- e.g. "August 1, 6-7PM". Different days: each side gets
its own full `dateLabel`, e.g. "June 1, 10PM - June 8, 3AM" -- never merged,
since "August 1, 6 - September 2, 7PM" reads as if `7PM` alone told you
anything about `August 1`'s own time.

`elm/time`'s `Time.Zone` only goes one direction (instant -> local wall
clock, via `Time.toHour`/etc.) -- there's no built-in inverse. This gets
there by guessing (treating the input's Y/M/D/H/M as if they were already
UTC, via `Shared.Conversions.daysFromCivil`), reading back what `zone` says
the wall-clock is at that guess, and correcting by the difference --
re-derived from the _original_ guess a second time (not chained onto the
already-corrected candidate, which would double-count a stable offset
instead of converging) so a guess landing right on a DST boundary still
converges (this app's own use, picking a cutoff date for an events filter,
doesn't need sub-minute precision across a boundary, but there's no reason
not to get it right).

{-| How far apart `Pages.Event.EventId_`'s "Add More" recurrence menu spaces
each newly-created `EventInstance` from the one before it -- `Daily`/`Weekly`
step by a fixed number of days (`1`/`7`), `Monthly` steps the calendar month
itself (clamping the day-of-month down when the target month is shorter,
e.g. Jan 31 + 1 month -> Feb 28/29), all via `addRecurrence`.
-}
type RecurrenceUnit
    = Daily
    | Weekly
    | Monthly


{-| `posix`'s own wall-clock time-of-day (in `zone`), `n` `unit`s later on the
calendar -- e.g. `addRecurrence zone Weekly 3 posix` is "3 weeks from
`posix`, same local time of day". Always re-resolves the result against
`zone`'s real DST transition history (via `posixFromDateTimeLocalInput`,
same as every other wall-clock -> `Posix` conversion in this module), so a
weekly 6-7PM series that crosses a DST change is still 6-7PM local time on
the other side of it, not 6-7PM's UTC-equivalent hour drifted by the
transition -- the same guarantee `formatRange`'s own doc describes for
`instanceWhenText`, just in the create direction instead of display.

`Daily`/`Weekly` add a fixed number of whole days (`n`/`n * 7`) to `posix`'s
own wall-clock date, letting month/year rollover happen naturally (adding
milliseconds to a UTC-as-if-local naive timestamp and reading the calendar
fields back off it, the same trick `posixFromDateTimeLocalInput` itself
uses internally). `Monthly` instead adds `n` to the month/year pair
directly, so "Jan 31 + 1 month" lands on the last day of February rather
than overflowing into March -- `daysInMonth` clamps the day-of-month down to
whatever the target month actually has.
