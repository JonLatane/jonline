# Generated Certs for Jonline
This folder contains the CA cert (`ca.pem`) and server cert (`server.pem`) for Jon's official Jonline instance (be.jonline.io). To secure Jonline on your own domain, you can either use a wildcard cert from a legit CA (like LetsEncrypt), contact me to use my custom CA (i.e. ask me to use my `ca.key` to generate you a `server.pem` and `server.key`) or use your own CA (i.e. generate and use your own `ca.key`).

(Note that `*.key` files are `.gitignore`d in this repo.)

## Use Cert-Manager (recommended)
These instructions should at least get you a lazy wildcard setup for a domain managed by DigitalOcean.

1. Point your DNS host (for instance, I use `be.jonline.io`), at the IP for your deployed `jonline` LoadBalancer instance. For the default Quick Start deploy, get it with: `kubectl describe service jonline -n jonline | grep 'LoadBalancer Ingress'`.
2. [Install Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
    * Currently their page says: `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.1/cert-manager.yaml`.
3. Securely store your DNS provider's credentials.
    1. ***Disable history in your shell***.
        * For ZSH or Bash, simply `unset HISTFILE`.
    2. Generate and store your Cert-Manager-supported DNS provider's credentials.
        * DigitalOcean: [Get an access token here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens), then `kubectl create secret generic digitalocean-dns --from-literal=access-token=<your access token here> -n jonline`.
        * Other DNS providers: TBD. Search the web for "`<your provider> cert-manager dns01 wildcard`" for a start!
            * Make a PR with your instructions here, a `backend/k8s/cert-manager.<your-provider>.template.yaml`, and new corresponding `make` targets for the next step!
4. Generate your Cert-Manager authority and certificate from the template included here, and apply them to your cluster.
    * DigitalOcean: `EMAIL=you@example.com TOP_LEVEL_CERT_DOMAIN=example.domain make deploy_certmanager_digitalocean_prepare deploy_certmanager_digitalocean_create`
5. Wait for your cert secret to be generated by Cert-Manager. In the default setup, it will appear in `get secret jonline-generated-tls -n jonline` once it's generated.
    * If something goes wrong, `kubectl describe certificate jonline-letsencrypt-cert -n jonline` to see details on what's going on with certificate generation.
6. `make deploy_be_restart` to use the Cert-Manager certificates.
7. You can validate your install with `make test_deploy_be`, similar to with an unsecured deployment. But now you must specify the domain. (By default, it targets your deployed external IP, and your domain cert isn't valid against an IP address.) So, simply do `TEST_GRPC_TARGET=example.domain:27707 make test_deploy_be`.

## Use certs from another CA
Perhaps you have a `server.pem` and `server.key` from your own CA. Make sure to specify the domain name you want the certs for (it can be a wildcard).

1. Ensure this directory has a `server.key` and your updated `server.pem` from your CA.
2. From the root of the repo, `make certs_server_store_in_k8s deploy_be_restart` to use your certs.
    * You can `make certs_delete_from_k8s deploy_be_restart` to switch back to non-TLS mode.

## Use your own custom CA
To deploy with your own custom CA (i.e. generate your own `ca.key` and overwrite the existing `ca.pem` with your own here):

1. Update `server.csr.conf` and `server.extfile.conf` to point to your domain. (If you ask me for a cert, I do this temporarily.)
2. From the root of the repo, `make certs_generate`.
    * This generates `ca.key`, `ca.pem`, `server.key`, and `server.pem`.
    * You can `make certs_ca_generate` or `make certs_server_generate` to generate either set of public/private keys independently. (If you ask me for a cert, I do the latter and send you the `server.key` and `server.pem`.)
3. Finally, `make certs_store_in_k8s` to store them, and `make deploy_be_restart` to restart your instance.
    * You can `make certs_ca_store_in_k8s` or `make certs_server_store_in_k8s` similarly.
4. You will need to provide both your `ca.pem` to end users if they use the official Jonline app. Alternatively, you could ship your own Jonline app with your own `ca.pem`.
