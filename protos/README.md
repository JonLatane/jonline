# Jonline gRPC API
This directory contains the Jonline gRPC APIs. It should be fairly straightforward to generate client APIs, complete with type and null safety, in nearly any language from these APIs.

## Licensing
The Jonline APIs (this directory) are released under the MIT license, while the core of Jonline is released under the AGPL. The purpose of this is to encourage third-party support and profitability for devs who build open- and closed-source apps *atop* Jonline's open-source core.
