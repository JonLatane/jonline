    <p>There's a lot to be done here.</p>
    <p>The idea is to have Rocket serve up Global Public-visibility Posts and Events
    using templates from this directory. Thus, web-friendly events and posts can be published and styled as the end-user wants.</p>
    <p>Target audiences for this feature: yoga, group fitness, group therapy, choruses, bands, concert venues, etc. Edit your events and posts (say, weather or health cancelations) with the Jonline app or Flutter Web UI, and have them on your website instantly!</p>
